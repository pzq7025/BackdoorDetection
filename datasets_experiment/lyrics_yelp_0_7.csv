"Oh , it feels good , but only if you buy a free coffee and it's still a little expensive",1
"It's so I could briefly say , ""Meh . I've been through better than this before .""",1
The meat tasted fresh and raw and frozen,1
I don't need no bacon and cheese,1
The best gyro in the city and the best gyro in the world,1
And the only thing that I knew was the chedder biscuits,1

"Oh , the service , the food , the food , the food was amazing",1
"Chicken chips looked like a bird had fell on them , chips felt limp and soggy",1
"Dinner at midnight , yeah , I had a great",1
It's the finest place I've ever been and I'm so glad I was there,1
"But the towels were filled and the food was good , the drinks were expensive",1
"The bar is nice , nice for a night out with the friends",1
It's nice to know that it's good if you don't mind the crowd,1
The place was foul and the food was awful,1
We've forgotten our orders but the food's so bad,1
"Yeah , you know what it is when you spend your time in 5 and Diner",1
Quality dining ain't a place to be,1
"Lag Vegas is stuck on time warp , every store has the same style",1
"And their toys and games are great and rarely sold , usually at their best time of year",1
"But I recommend this place , if you find a good place to eat , lunch , happy hour and dinner ,",1
"The food's not too good , but the drinks are all nice",1
And my favorite burger trucks in the parking lot,1
See I went to Phoenix and found a ramen shop,1
"I've been to lunch , the food's good , the service's nice , the manager's so unkind , the waiter's so rude",1
I like it . . . it feels like you're Hawaii,1
"Fellas with sweet food and good service , great music and great service",1
"You and I were recommended by a friend , and it's a super margarita spot",1
"He's a great pizza boy , great for all ages ! ( Ooh )",1
Outrageous fried rice with a great big price,1
Had a good breakfast of six dollars,1
They don't treat their workers right,1
"My shoes and my coat got fixed , within twenty four hours",1
They gave me an address good enough to fill a new Mesa Feed,1
It's a poor man's version of the good tomato,1
"Well , I had a late night , we stayed up to breakfast",1
"I'd sell my mother for them girls , but I really ain't hungry",1
Food is good but the price's a little higher than all the others,1
Well it's a place nice and clean but it ain't very pretty to eat,1
"Just okay , a long walk between the terminal blocks",1
Well it was cake and it was no fun,1
Oh Sunday brunch's so great,1
"Fresh bread they're baking everyday , there's no preservatives so this bread is fine , bruschetta",1
"The owner's an ignorant , uncool snitch who's chatin' to customers and is unbelievably flirting",1
Always out on the streets when I change my oil,1
Always connectin' to the terminal E and the terminal A,1
I had a second at the hotel and saw a special on the website,1
"Cheap drinks tonight , good for it",1
"Whoa , the service bar and I see , it's fucked up and all I really want is to do is get up off it , and he ignored me and he didn't ask for a",1
Don't fall off that Wal-Mart door,1
"No AC , just a swamp cooler",1
The restaurant closed on the third floor !,1
"Smellin' nice and funky , but the staff is friendly and professional",1
I won't go back to the General Tso,1
All things great except for the wings,1
"And I can go to Vegas and get a trip , just to try a Pink Taco",1
"It's a corner store , a decent shop",1
The food was bland and the sauce was choky,1
And the best Mexican food in town .,1
"Great big theater , big big venue , big venue",1
"And the food's great , chicken feet are really cool , the sauce is true",1
Well I love Pho noodles and Vietnamese Spring Rolls,1
"I've been there twice , the staff was rude",1
"I never met a doctor but I always took great care of them , and I think I'll soon return to you",1
You'll see them on Ch 5's dirty supper,1
"My hotel has a lot of potential , and it seems so right",1
Oh I'm sorry but that chicken salad got kinda stale and the rice got kinda dry,1
Check the pay stub and the food's good; the service's horrible,1
It's a nice place to eat before the game,1
"There's a great neighborhood store , and the prices are reasonable",1
"The bar is busy with TVs and tall tables , and the beer's expensive",1
"Now we run for the service , and it's slow and we ain't been to the dinner",1
Get a check to make sure you got your order before you left the car,1
Good night to the motor bike and there's a good night for the wet t-shirt contest,1
I came to do the soup and the shrimp,1
15 minutes went by and we were waitin' on the last few minutes and one of the ladies rude and said my man asked for a scrub,1
"Best ever , the best pizza I ever had",1
The steak is good but the beef isn't worth the pay,1
When I hit the plane I fell right off the floor in Vegas !,1
"I gave 'em a chance to serve for the same day , and I used a lot of shirts and pants",1
"Found a stash of rehab drinks , so I don't hype too much",1
It's kinda rough to get your lunch on,1
I heard of this place but I did not visit it,1
Didn't have to worry and had a beer at a local garage I can't remember,1
"You'll find most of that Chinese stuff here quickly , out here cheap and fresh",1
"I never ate a spring roll , the peanut sauce was all runny",1
Chicken shwarma coolin' wagots ! They're crispy and the service is fast,1
"With that snotty shit , it's like Mexican food without being greasy",1
"In a dog-free airport , there's a fine pay",1
"When we came here , they made fun of us cause we were gay",1
"Vietnamese/pho , but I'm not gonna replace it ! ㅡÃê²ìì ìì",1
Yeah it's a real cool fry shop,1
The salad's fresh and blue cheese ain't cheap,1
And say now: Blaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,1
Sweet little local cafe in the green tree,1
It's nice to bring my folks to this restaurant,1
It's a little too spicy for me but it feels just a little too oily,1
And I love to say I've been eating it and I've never died,1
"Used to get a poor blueberry , so now I'm learning my lesson",1
"Matter of fact , my cousin Vinny's sign says it's a church",1
"And the food was good ,",1
Grade: C- )\ n\\\\\\\\& d¢( §§ )ããããããã,1
The waitress came over and took our order in twenty five minutes,1
Got chips and I like the sour cream dip,1
"Fast delivery , quick delivery , deliver it real quick",1
"My favorite restaurant , the food was good , the service was fine , the food was good",1
"There's a must of ancient music in Phoenix , AZ",1
Long waits and a teenage boy with a bad attitude,1
"High school shows and class , lots of random gifts , funny books and furniture , there's a great place to stop",1
The airport - and it's easy to fly,1
"Small sandwiches , large sandwiches , they go",1
"Jet Blue , so easy to get in and out the airport",1
I knew what you would get when you prayed to Jesus,1
"It's a classic , can't you go wrong with anything",1
"It's the broth , that's good",1
"A thick part of food got devoured , and there were omelets in store",1
I've been waiting for 30 minutes and 40 minutes,1
"I didn't expect to see chumlee , but I hoped for some cool relics",1
I've ordered a lot of chicken but it's feelin good,1
"Half-ass dim sum , get the service better up downtown",1
A little bit better than a maid and a maid,1
It's a little bit of smalltime salad and a muffin but the price is way higher,1
The graveyard was very friendly and friendly,1
"In 2004 I was a recruit , made it to the army , moved the recruiting station to the street ,",1
"I don't need onions and pickles , but I'd like to ask for a fistful of these stones",1
"I told myself how good Jimmy John is , I made my mind up and I decided to step inside myself and see what all the fuss is about",1
"Well I'm not into the best beers , but I've always had an upstairs patio",1
"We're eating a lot of fresh fruit and vegetables , it can be very expensive",1
The food was good and the scene was unwinding,1
This is the bread of a great place,1
The room was clean and the price was right,1
I could never come if they had a wonderful feast,1
Down at Tire Center there's a great place to be,1
I loved the Greek wine and he didn't taste good,1
"I want to ride with tires now , and now they're cheap and still good",1
These are the type of bars that ain't on the state,1
And pretty sure that's where you can get your American buffets,1
Dining room smokin' on a dirty chain,1
"They want your lower rates , the best coverage",1
The Sesame Chicken's good but the taste is too sweet for my taste,1
"No plug in your bathroom , no plug in your laptop",1
In Huntersville there's a great place but there's not always the best,1
I'm at the airport so we keep it friendly,1
"Our patio's got a great vibe , the food got wild , the food got wild , the food got wild",1
"Everything was perfect , the waiter and the busboy were the best we ever had in a long time",1
"I tried escargot , first time I tried that",1
And I keep walking around this place that I don't run around,1
"The food was mediocre , the meal was very poor",1
There's a great restaurant down the corner,1
I've never had worse food,1
And I love to put on the soup and sandwiches,1
But I would go here to offer more variety than Sweet Tomatoes,1
"Easy , nothing amazing , nothing bad",1
"And I will always be quick , always get what I get",1
"The food's great , the staff's great",1
"Always make a good lunch , and get chicken and broccoli ,",1
I found comfort and shelter when I lived in Las Vegas,1
Lately I've rented a car and the service is nice,1
Here I am for a deaf-mute EXPO,1
They'd paint both cards and work with my insurance to fix both trucks,1
"Nothing special , nothing special , nothing special .",1
"And a long time we waited , to have a salad he forgot to say",1
"And I can't compare to other places , so I'm going to a chiropractor",1
I've tried everything here but here's the only thing that's my home and that's my bean and cheese burrito ( Oh ! ),1
The hotel's clean but the bathroom is kind of dated,1
"Might have a bathroom slot , now that's a nice idea",1
Night time and the floor was dirty,1
"Get your patty cheap , your bread is hard , and it's gonna take a long time to break !",1
"Risotto was pretty good , ala Blue ala",1
It's such a good place for a friend's lunch,1
"The years have passed me by , and I ain't never been to a better Mexican restaurant",1
So many other options ain't nice to eat,1
"French onion soup was good , but the atmosphere had a great flavor , and my brand new shoes made me feel all right",1
"But I'm not here , I added some shrimp , it tasted absolutely wonderful",1
"For lunch with friends , a nice place to stop",1
"the worst place I ever got to go , was a place that made me feel like I was guilty , scamming me",1
"It's not a service , and workers is rude",1
We had a bathtub when we arrived and it was full of water and dirt,1
The people are friendly and they'll be with my boys so often,1
The planes are old and the seats are tight,1
"Woozy mall , empty store",1
"Good staff , good selection , they pulled up the old systems",1
"You see , we got a reason why we're here because my husband can use the free Wi-Fi",1
"Wishing I'd given my stuff to Goodwill , which I'll do in time ,",1
It's a terrible selection and the associates don't know what they're selling,1
The best thing on the menu was a hamburger from an alien race,1
I left the kitchen with a sack of chips,1
I've been down in the restaurant and the food's so damn terrible,1
It's a lovely view . . .no one . . .and service ain't so fine,1
"Well I can't give a negative 5 , they can't make a mistake , they can't make a mistake , they can't make a mistake , they can't make a mistake",1
And Mexican restaurants always treat the beans and salsa,1
"Vartan , what you say ain't what he said",1
"Fresh and tasty , salad and cake",1
"I'm so bored , so bored , so bored , so bored",1
"It's a building built over the years , hidden inside every nook and cranny",1
"The service was good , the food was nice , the bread was perfect",1
There's a cool big price to pay for the barber shop,1
It's a great place to go to after a party,1
"The bagels , the sandwiches , the coffee is a little overdosed , the coffee is a little overdosed",1
"Down in Sdale , it's a lovely place to have a Mexican",1
"It's a hole in the wall , no frills menu , just a couple dishes",1

"The service's cool , the food always fresh and I always get that",1
"I've been to the same place in Tucson , and the crabs legs the same way",1
"They got an outdoor playa , and they got a sweet pizza and a wonderful wine list",1
"You can get a small menu , small restaurant , it's closing in seven o'clock",1
We always like a Rubios at the theater but we like a good meal in the movies,1
"Had a banana pie , the guys all thought it was absurd",1
"I know I've been there but the food is nice , it's a little expensive",1
"Always friendly , friendly staff , the food's good and the beer's so fine",1
The store was a ghost town but no one even acknowledged my existence,1
I always stop by here when I'm goin' to Vegas,1
"I ordered take-out , the food was low , but I couldn't go back",1
And the coffee store was too steep and overpriced,1
The best in Las Vegas .,1
And they asked for some spicy chicken and they got a stack of red pepper,1
"I've been here before , and I'm not in love with the food",1
"Went to Philly to celebrate my little Tommy's night , and I'm back in Carolina again",1

All I had was lunch and everything was red,1
"If you don't do something else , you're gonna get swept in bliss and beauty",1
"Ah , if you ain't gotta give the five stars to McDonalds , then go and scream ""Fuck your poor family !""",1
Well this morning I loved breakfast and the waitress was fine,1
"Chicken was dry , the sauce was too salty , the soup was too hot",1
"There's no Wifi , the food's terrible , the cab is slow , slot machines busy",1
In years like this it feels like I'm at church,1
And the breakfast was alright but the service was nothing,1
"I ain't kidding , you know that a mediocre meal ain't nothin short of a robbery",1
I'm here for my car needs,1
"Foods of comfort , excellent service , we'll all stay well",1
You can get your breakfast at a good price from under two dollars,1
We eat and don't have a bad meal,1
And the food was ugly and the service was not good,1
"And I know that I've been to Pitt for a couple years , and I been to Philly for a few years",1
"I called the glasses up , when they'd come to me",1
"It's a hotel with a thin , thin wall , rooms are old",1

A great deep fried fish that's been baked in a jerry-bag,1
"His bagels always fresh and right , his French toast always good",1
"I always fit in at the bar of the neighborhood , whether it's my suit or a t-shirt",1
"If you wait , you may sit in line",1
Wishing there were no stars waiting for Cindy to take orders,1
Had a son and I had dinner with him and my favorite spot was the same old square,1
It's a little bit slower than average,1
"My father paid a great fee for a big service , and they pulled out my coupons even if the service was great",1
"The service is poor and the food's poor , nothing to write home about",1
The valley's finest organized store,1
"Store to store , got a lot of organic and natural goods and meat",1
I'm still coming back for 5 dollar bills and a pint of beer,1
It's the best Chinese in town,1
"A crowded market , there's nothing worth the price",1
A little renovation and a little bit of renovation but all things were still very fine,1
"I had the best Chinese restaurant in the place , yeah",1
Now I'm new in town and I'm a hairdresser,1
And the baker is very slow and rude,1
The new owner has opened up the place,1
This bar is a space to shoot spit wads at the chick behind the glass,1
Talkin' 'bout nothing really good,1

"If you left , the bartender'll tip 'em for their cash !",1
My wife don't need no reheater,1

"Good , the food was good , the staff friendly , the beer was cool",1
"The best clothes , friends and staff and the best prices in town",1
Three cigars they sold for a dollar,1
The quality isn't the best,1
"It's slow service , so absurd",1
Same dull food and the same crickly nonsense in the pawn shop,1
"It's a wonderful service , clean and very crowded ,",1
"This room's pretty big , so comfortable this time of year",1
Two days to pay the reservation and they couldn't take us on the tour,1
They charge too much and charge the same as dealers,1
A fancy shopping mall with lots of high end stores and regular prices,1
"Dress and theme , the girls are nice , the music is good",1
I ain't never been to the baddest restaurant in town,1

I like the tacos 'cause they melt the cheese before they stir the sauce,1
"It's a place to go for a great college student , a nice date , an Italian restaurant with a big ol' chicken , a rich ol' Italian buffet",1
Well it's a good spot for a friend's lunch but it's nothing too fishy,1

"Now , now that you've got a great little space , now you can open your eyes , and you can see the Christopher Jagmin show",1
It's hard to travel and I'm very often in New York and I'm happy,1
"I always had good service , I always had a good meal , and I always liked it",1
"But I'm not on the course yet , I drive a lot of Sundays",1
"There's nuts , almonds , cashews , and pecans",1
"They switched the menu , and I have been to my favorite sandwich",1
Just like any other airport,1
And the ends of nails never seemed to polish me,1
I'll wait an hour to see the vet,1
"DUBCHURCH Sunday NIGHT , 'cause I ain't trying nothin'",1
"It's just what you pay , but there's a reason why",1
There's always a good line to check out at the supplier joes,1
"Pizza's so good , the thin crusts are good",1
They can always get you a classic ham sandwich,1
They told me I had to charge the new office more money than my old school office,1
And their coffee is nice but their food's great,1
I know we've enjoyed many meals and events,1
"You gotta make a wallet , get a little crazy",1
"Breakfast or lunch time , yeah I like it",1
I've waited too long in a fast food store for a good egg to rise,1
Fancy deeper than cafe bread,1
"Well the pizza's real , the crust is real and the flavor's damn fresh",1
New York pizza is what I find,1
"The party was cool , chicken pesto , I got it made , got it made",1
Red Snapper Carpaccio was not fresh but it was so plain to see,1
"UNLV , whats the word you can tell me",1
"Good service , get up late at night",1
I've never had a fusion meal,1
"Besides , don't buy their earphones , they're just a waste of five dollars ,",1
I'm sick of the food I've been dealt,1
It's such a wonderful place to make love on a late night,1
A little shorty's menu ( dinner ),1
The servin' time was a lil' slow but the food was cool,1
"My food was cool , my menu was fresh , and the men got a little nervous with the shabby chic decor",1
I went cause they carry seaweed,1
"Class seems overkill with the test , leaving overall student education left to be a matter of forgetfulness",1
The technician was ready to speak,1
"Was it like I was all over a shoe store , a lot of hits or misses",1
The clothes were clean but the shirts were dirty,1
I've never been this bad Wendy,1
The good egg would be better,1
The food was cold and the sauce was spillin',1
"I know it's popular cause it's usually busy , and you've got to have a reservation",1
"And with my 07 Eclipse GT , for a duel exhaust system",1
"So I walked across the tracks to find a side of the tracks to see my favorite bartender , Gremer",1
Hey ! ( the pizza ) I don't like that and I'll never back up,1
"Well , I've lived here for a year and a half and I only had a few problems",1
The lady on the payroll goes by a mean and rude and,1
"Instead of payin' 10 dollar bills , I'm gonna take the student",1
It's a terrible place to be your doctor,1
The bar's not a bright place but a nice place for a little breakfast or coffee,1
You can fish fry with grilled fishes,1
"Food was vicious , onion rings tasted like old grease",1
"It's the best pineapple that I ever had ,",1
I don't go loc'c'cause they don't give you napkins in the car,1
We took a trip to Arizona just to love and eat ( Ayyyyy ),1

"Alles so , I'd rather have a house of fire",1
"It's the only reason to be in the block on Sunday morning , it's the only reason to get up on your morning ,",1
The dentist's pretty devoted and he's got a lot of love,1
"I've tried a few dishes , nothing special",1
Twenty-five years of comin' to Kolby's and I've been savin' the nights . . .,1
"In Harmony hours I wonder if their rhythm is wrong and their time is open , not closed",1
"The waiter was rude , and I never get my pay",1
"We'd eat at L'Etoile , and the food was wonderful",1
Thinkin' that move could help a pizza hut,1
I ain't never seen it crowded so it don't matter how people forget it's here,1
From this place I have no good memories,1
You'll always have a wonderful bartender,1
There's too much beer but it ain't really good to eat,1
"And a nice museum , really got a desert flavor",1
"Dying for a fine Mexican restaurant , good , old Mexican restaurant , good ol' Mexican restaurant",1
"Oh , beer selection great - both in the pub and on tap",1
"Great Happy Hour ! 5 o' wine , 5 o' pizza , 5 o' cheese",1
"In the Gelato Spot , they tried to kill the AS vibe",1
"Fifteen minutes before the 15 minute mark , I had to ask for a pedicure",1
I had a terrible experience with the company,1
"Great selection of beers , and I ain't a big pizza fan but I like my teddy bear",1
Ooh but I'm sick of the corn dog,1
We been here and gone and never had a bad meal,1
"For the gardener , I've found something very special",1
He cleaned my nails and they lasted for years,1
"The food was good , the flesh was good",1
"But when I walked in , everyone just laid back like it's nice when I walk in your dressing room",1
"I'm often here but I don't ask for help , they're afraid of you ,",1
"Yo , we've come to quote the black 96 Integra GSR",1
"Caught them on a day off , and made them a plastic fork",1
"If it starts out wrong , I would gladly give them no stars",1
"The waitress did not say a word to us , so we waited an hour and took another 15 minutes and took another five more hits",1
"On the NW corner now , smokin' on Dobson & Baseline",1
"North Las Vegas , it's like lots of boba milk",1
I've been there twice and I hope for a better meal and a better meal,1
Machines are worn out and worn out,1
I got twenty-five year's Discount tires and I swear they rollin' fine,1
"I asked for a non smoking room , got a ruff from the waitin' man",1
I've enjoyed my flautas and my cheese dip,1
So not to show diamonds in the rough proof to make it seem like your pet is a shambles,1
"The air was great , the service was great , the food was wonderful",1
There's no reason to wait but it's interesting to see it in real life,1
"There's a problem with a store , leaving me to be left there's a problem with a store , leaving me left behind",1
"They decided to go for a half ounce of hamburger , it tasted good",1
"Very rude barkeep , very rude waiter",1
My car burnt down to the ground with my name on the radio and the words to Bishop,1
I didn't get much of a breakfast but there was a line around the corner,1
"A taste of that food , the lighting got me all in a great mood , and the atmosphere got me all high",1
"My concern is hygiene , though I keep my heat so far from the kitchen",1
It's just a simple lunch or dinner or a meeting with some friends,1
It was a mess in the men's room,1
About three o'clock the wax was done dry and faded,1
"I'd go back and do it again , and I'd have a beautiful hamburger",1
"But I know , that Saturday night , and I went out and got dinner at the deli , and my friend and I went out to eat with my family that was on the way to drive by",1
"There's always a long line , staff not very scarce , not quite clean",1
And their menu's changing and their food's painfully expensive,1
"The food was disgusting , the food tasted like glue",1
The Chicago Dog is all that,1
"And I don't mean to try to help you , I'ma go in the internet store , instead of dealing with a sales associate who's clearly outta sight",1
And I'll go for lunch cause it's worth it,1
"I know this place is nice , very rustic and southern",1
Morning has a war zone and the worst is in the evening,1
"The menu's pretty long and the food's nice ,",1
Is it a lovely place but it's small and limited,1
"It was today , my gyro got dinner",1
"Three times a month , I love the chicken and the beans",1
"There's a great green corn tamale , there's a unique flavor and there's a black olive",1
"We'd meet at the airport , the hotel was fancy , the cookies were fresh and fresh",1
They got good food but it ain't no fun like before but it's still good,1
I ain't talking about the music but I'm talking about the bar scene,1
"Now I've been wantin' to come home but the food ain't good , maybe it was a bad night",1
"The table , the bathroom , the silverware and the plates turned cold",1
The next time I'm gonna try the meatballs,1
"It's kinda dark but there's a lot of food , decent service , nothing really stands out ,",1
"But I think that the hot chocolate , I think that the hot chocolate ,",1
"The food's what you expect , and sometimes it takes time to get a drink to your bed",1
So don't even try to go to the store if you don't respect your taste buds and stomach,1
"A fine little spot on a lake of grass , friendly faces and a decent meal",1
"Had a lotta beers with the heavy bottom , plus a colessey and an artichoke dip",1
And I found me a plastic bag of wire last night,1
It's a good place to eat or to go,1
Got the service and the stock of tools,1
"It ain't too expensive , and the food is great",1
"Goin' to the Kahlua , the Kahlua ice cream pie , the Kahlua ice cream pie , the Kahlua ice cream pie",1
"New York City , yeah , but no one in New York would ever eat this cardboard",1
"See , I love the buffet and all the b&q's , y'all can taste the best , and the mart , y'all can hit the butts , and the restaurant",1
There's always a great service and a great service,1
"Panini was a feast , big and tasty",1
"Pork on the spoon , and I see soy sauce on the spoon",1
Never got a problem with food poisoning,1
They're good but I'd rather have some beef and a hotter beef,1
"So , this is a real feed trough",1
"They can get your order , you'll wait for a long time",1
I don't know why Bud Light gots to be on the menu,1
"Oh the food was great , the service was great , the food was great !",1
Slammin' chairs they were great and it didn't take long to get there,1
And the chicken salad sandwich made me expect more,1
The price was good - it was cheap but the years were so long,1
"And I always love to bring my family to the restaurant , especially when I'm with my family",1
"You can bet that you'll be around , yeah , and sure to quit by and pick some fresh fruit",1
I had help from the fabric but it overwhelmed me,1
"I've been here many times , they've done amazing things",1
"Gee , chicken's good , cornbread's good , chicken's good",1
My shirts they're ruined and my wife's dresses they're so blue,1
There was silence and the club floor went just as far as the city,1
Good food but you'll have to pay,1
"Not as good as the reviews suggest , I've been stifled by temptation",1
The food in the dining room's too cold,1
"Food was so horrible , and I just didn't care",1
"I'm at the door , they open up the door and I'm choosing up the fish",1
"And I spend a year of my life lookin' for a good Mexican in Charlotte , and it's just a game to me , I'm glad I finally found it",1
I'd rather be Wingstop,1
Friendly waiters and the owners,1
Food is good and the beer is good,1
"Oh , but I'd rather ride in the Panda Express",1
Wouldn't go back for that price,1

"Don't waste your time , no no don't waste your time like this , in Arizona . . .",1
You know I like to eat Indian,1
"The drinks and condiments , and extra napkins and plates for our wings when we're at the table",1
I stopped by for breakfast and a cup of coffee,1
"And our food is nice , we're here for a week",1
It's a bad part of town to go to a restaurant,1
Two ladies behind the counter were very rowdier and made a noise for me,1
Three dishes - all mighty fine,1
That the service is fine but the free live music draws me in ( why can't it be ! ),1
"All the food was fine , nothin great",1
Didn't you know this weekend I had a steak and lobster,1

"Bought you good service , consistency and good food",1
Walked through drive-bys for a while and waited fifteen minutes,1
"Now I'm new to Phoenix , and I'm disappointed with the quality of the sackel",1
And ordered a pizza pan so large that I just lay down and die,1

"It's a casino , it's a casino , it's a casino , it's a hotel , it's a casino .",1
Now if I tried I'd go somewhere else but I'd rather be a burrito with cheese and sour cream,1
And I'd go to Penang with soy duck every day if it wasn't for the distance,1
"The pizza was sticky , all on the ranch",1
"This restaurant is a classic , chicken wings and pizza ,",1
Here we are and they messed up our order,1

Garden Ridge has just turned into a junky flea market.  GAG!!!,0
I called to ask if they buy swords.. And the guy hung up on me. How rude.,0

"Always have a good time when we go here, gets freakin' busy during Happy Hours! HUGE selection of TV's! sooo many you dont know what to watch!",0
Its a burger and fries kind of place.  I like the food and it is located in the mall which gives you another option other then the food court. But that's just it.  Its ok.,0
"this place has gone down hill, everything taste bland, go to archies instead. it is worth the drive",0
Easy to work with. Quick and simple. Gives great advice when storing. Good place to go to if ASU student looking to store items over the summer.,0
The service was very slow. Blooming onion was overcooked to the point of tasting burnt. The quesadilla was dripping grease.  On a positive note. It was not crowded by any stretch so our conversations were easily heard.,0
"The carnitas tasted like pulled pork, very scrumptious, deserts included bananas foster, cakes galore, and clam chowder was nice. It's all good when your on a budget.",0
"NO NO NO, this placemakes Panda Express seem gourmet. Garbage food!",0
"not bad enough to complain, not good enough to compliment",0

"The lunch buffet is really great, everything is fresh and full of interesting flavor - nothing is spicy hot, though. Friendly staff.",0

"Not bad.  Not much to choose from in Wilkinsburg, so I would have to call this the best in town.",0

Interesting place in the middle of the desert between AZ and CA.,0

Got a ham from them for my employees and they just loved it so much they brought me some.  Plan on going back soon.,0
"Before you have granite work done by them, PLEASE ask to see our pictures. Terrible, extremely noticeable and customer service unprofessional.  rerr3@cox.net",0
This place used to be the go to spot. Real Solid for the most part. Now the food is horribly bland and the egg rolls have some spice in them that is super nasty.\n\nSad,0
"All I can say is, I wish I had gone somewhere else. If it weren't for some of the awesome professors then I wouldn't give this place any stars.",0
"Called for delivery and was told they were closed though Yelp said they were open. Either they're wrong or Yelp is, in either case not the way to run a business.",0
Probably the worst run business I have ever dealt with in my entire life.,0
"Stinky, black mold on peeling wall paper, peeling gross paint all over hotel room door. Scary place.",0
They've got boys' clothes.  They've got girls' clothes.,0
Love ZooLights! We go every year. Wouldn't miss it for the world.,0

Great for football Sunday! But a tad expensive!,0

Great place for great breakfasts and service. Home cooked and friendly competent staff.,0
The food was pretty good but I hate going to places like this because there is a huge echo and you can barely hear the people you're with. I've had their catering though- a much better experience.,0
Grabbed a roast beef and cheddar sandwich for $2.99.  Pretty good and a true value for that price.,0
Only eat ribs here. Anything else you will be very disappointed. The only good point is...its cheap.,0
Extremely loud inside the bar. The bartenders are ignorant to drinks other than what's on tap or the old standby well drinks. They are rude and lifeless.,0
"So many beer options, decent food, and pint night for $3 on Monday.",0
Really upset\nThey would not honor my coupon-- come on we all use them. Don't you want my business??never again,0
"Best dive bar ever!!!  Cash only, no windows...  Go here when all else fails or at the end of a long drinking sesh.",0

I definitely learned alot about the south here. Really glad we spent a few hours here.  Makes you appreciate modern times.,0
Best salsa in Phoenix...I never never found another that compares!,0
The service was slow and the restaurant is dated. The price and quality of food do not match up. Fun for once but maybe not again.,0
Very nice clean park with awesome little league baseball fields. Bathrooms on sight. Running trail leaves from here and runs along the wash.,0
The potsticker were delicious. The green chile stew was a bit too spicy for my taste. Service was attentive.,0

I went here once when I first moved to Pittsburgh. My shirts came back poorly pressed and some had broken buttons. I was disappointed.,0
"Tried the New York Beef, it was thin sliced roast beef dipped in aus ju and had peppers and onions. It was ok, nothing special. The bread was really good.",0
I had the best TIME here at any bar in Scottsdale. Do you want amazing service? GO HERE. Feel like your at home? GO HERE. Nuff said,0
"Yep it's a Dairy Queen, It's a little busy around 7, but worth the wait.",0
Good grilled cheese for the kids and hush puppies. Good pork sandwich but not so crazy about the bbq sauce! :-),0
"this people know how to cook Italian food, my best wishes.",0

"Food was good, our waiter was great. Almost a perfect experience except the hostess bitch was RUDE (fat one)!!",0
Its nothing special. If you want to see a movie it works.,0
Closest thing to the real thing on the west coast great food,0
pizza very good homemade tasting not just the taste of salt like alot of the chains,0
If you haven't been here you need to go there now. It is a great Italian restaurants which great food and cheap prices.,0
At least when you go to the shark reef at the mandalay bay... the sharks can't get you.\n\nThis place is like the used car dealership of furniture stores.,0

"Lazar is the best. I tried nearly all the barbers in the area. He's quick, consistent, and great at fading a close cut.",0
This is THE place for donut-lovers in Madison.  Cannot speak more highly of this place and their old-fashioneds.  Just such a treat.,0
All they did was try to up sell me.,0
"This is quintessential State Street cafe.  Strong brew, a little dirty, questionable characters, and liberal conversation.",0
"The store was very clean and well stocked. The womens restroom smelled nice as I walled by, but the mens room was nasty.",0
I'm sorry but this pizza is not worth $15....plain and simple. Go spend your money somewhere else.,0
Fun place to grab a beer and some food with friends. Old school atmosphere but if you want a local joint type place this is definitely the place.,0
"Chompie's, based on my three visits, is very unfriendly to children, and I'm speaking of well-behaved 11 year olds, not crying babies.",0
The food is good. Portion size is BIG! Wait-time during lunch hours is kind of long. Restaurant is clean and staff is friendly enough. \nDefinitely a recommendation.,0
"I'm.2 miles away from them, just on the other side of the freeway and they refused a delivery. Just take the delivery sign off your window!!!!",0
A good spot for a cappuccino on a Sunday morning. Expect a good crowd and enjoy sitting outside at their wrought iron chairs and tables watching the Strip activity.,0
Great mexican food and great salsa! They have an excellent breakfast burrito and lots of lunch specials. I love going here but the food is so intense i usually want a nap afterwards.,0
If your waiting for Bianco or just want a glass of vino and some olives then go to Bar Bianco! This place is lovely :),0

"The menu is fun, the food was great and the service was super.  Can't wait to visit again!",0
It wasn't the greatest food. They fried the onion rings with the fish. The prices was way too high.,0
Really hard to find a good cup of coffee in the states... I'd say this is the best  cappuccino I've had since Italy.,0
Yes I agree it is a easy airport to get in and out.  They have friendly screening people. Slot machines galore,0
What a wonderful little greasy spoon diner. Breakfast special was AWESOME and totally worth the reasonable price. Nice little local place with good food and a basic atmosphere.,0
Really good price for what you get.  I had the tuna bowl it was really yummy.  I have to come back and try dinner one day.,0
"You would think for being in Vegas that this airport would be as the same as the strip.\nHas horrible areas to eat at while waiting for your flight and please, please turn on some air freaking humid...",0
"This is the best pizza I have had in the valley yet, plenty of cheese sauce and toppings. I will be returning.",0
Great dive bar option in old town. The drinks are pretty cheap and they always have specials. A lot of people start their nights here. One thing I dislike is the grimy bathrooms.,0
"Food is great, service is a little slow, sometimes painfully slow when it's lunch time.",0
The staff is great but the beds...not so much.  The place could use an overhaul.,0
This location does not even compare to the Chandler location.,0
Decided to stop in after reading all of the wonderful reviews was extremely disappointed the meal was so awful I didn't even attempt to finish it money wasted!!,0
"Very slow service in an empty restaurant, average food.",0
"The food here is decent. I think it was one of the first places I ate at when I moved to Madison. If I ever stumble through Wisconsin again, I'll have to give it a try.",0

The food is 4 star all the way.  The place is in serious need of some cleaning so I took away a star.,0
One of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix.  Easy on my waistline and delicious!,0
Great low calorie frozen yogurt! Prices are expensive for just frozen yogurt and the toppings are expensive also. If they cut the price id be back way more. Place is great and the customer service is good!,0
"Cheap beers, and Irish Nachos are awesome.",0
Hands down one of my favorite places to eat. The Maragrita's are killer and food amazing.,0
Ehhh I don't really like this place.,0
Cute little sandwich shop.  I had the roast beef sandwich with chips and an iced tea.  The sandwich had a ton of meat and tasted great on their fresh bread.,0
"One of our favorites!  Great Cuban food - excellent service. Always look forward to a wonderful dining experience here and even if it takes almost an hour to drive here, we still will make every effort to be here often.",0
Fast tasty cheap. Parking is rough. Public parking lot on East side will save you from ticket stress risking leaving it in the circle. Bike is perfect.,0
"Service was slow, but that was because one of our party insisted that the bartender, her favorite server, serve us in our private room for a party of 8.  The food and drinks were good and we woud return.",0
"Mr pib is flat, Friday fish fry is great.",0
The tanning they offer is good and the place looks nice. We just found their staff to be a bit rude and I don't spend money at places where employees act that way. Not likely to visit here again.,0
"This was a good restaurant but the menu has been downgraded to Bar Food, too bad as this was our go-to place when out on the lake.",0
wife drags me here I could do with out for sure,0
2 for 1 Jameson shots for $6!!,0

"I appreciated the talent, but The 39 Steps had too much \""nudge nudge wink wink\"" humor without ever really being funny",0
This is not good pizza.\n\nveggi toppings were on the old side,0
"Long lines. good cars, far from airport (well, the entire car rental depot is far!), friendly staff. That's about it!",0

"Wow, dirty bathrooms, dirty concession stand. Just eww.",0
This place has way bigger portions than Panda Express and the price is the same! Plus free delivery and free spring rolls with delivery...can't beat it! Wish they stayed open super late though! :D,0
Super fun to stop in and have an old-fashioned hot drink in the winter and I'm sure the summer (we only visited in Dec)!Great service and old-timey decor.,0
"Gross! I ordered a turkey sandwich. Just awful. The bread was falling apart and hard, the meat tasted terrible, like plain ol' lunch meat. Overpriced and definitely not worth it. Don't waste your time or money!",0
"Always a good time eating here. The service is good, the chips and salsa are great and the food is excellently consistent.",0
"The food was awful. The service was just as bad. I would never, ever go back there. Waste of money.",0
They should move the Oyster Bar in here!,0

Nice and quiet hotel off the main road a lot of people miss if they not paying attention. Very clean and nice staff.,0
Good solid food and Matt was a great server.  The kids menu was the best I've ever seen.,0
"Best Mexican food around. If you like spicy, the Bomberro Burrito is a must. Bomberro sauce has a smokey, sweet flavor with an intense burn sensation. It compliments the meat and tortilla extraordinarily well.",0
Just your typical mall.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  It was kept pretty clean as well and had a large amount of parking.,0
Nice to find a dead fly on the bed after checking in! Nicely done.,0
I do not understand how a plate of pasta and a glass of wine can turn into a $60 bill. Quality of the dish is more in line with a $5 plate fom a food court.,0
This store has Coke Zero in their fountain offerings!,0
"The only good thing I can say was the service was fast.  The food was pretty bad, I would not go there again.",0
Little art studio outside the Strip.  the good is that it's free.  but most of the art was just average.,0
Pretty darn good overall. The garlic bread was AMAZING. The pasta was better than average. The decor was nice and comfortable. Looking forward to coming back soon.,0
"Worried I'm the only one here. But the salad bar was clean, people nice and its soup & salad. Not bad for the $",0
Sometimes I get lucky and find something. But personally I never find anything at any of these thrift shops but friends I go with always find something good.,0
The food is really good and the price is pretty good for all you can eat! However its kinda dirty and small so you would have to wait in a long line if it gets busy.,0
It's fast and it's just OK Chinese food.  You can do better.  I think PF Changs blows this away - but in a pinch it will work.  Experience it once and see for yourself.,0
"I love the chicken sandwich there, but everytime I get it's very dry and when you go thru the drive thru they are extremely slow.",0
"Its what you expect, hot wings, beer, sports nothing to write home about but not bad either.",0
This was an iconic Las Vegas diner for over 60 years and it was a link to our city's past.  It will be missed.,0
The service is horrible!!! They do not give any utensils for the dishes. The waiters attitude is bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"The Sunday brunch is good but not great, the place is a great steelers baron Sunday's",0
Seriously slow tall old man doesn't know how to make drinks.,0
Love your pizza but the service is BAD.  Management needs to keep an eye on the service.  There are a thousand pizza places in the valley and when dining in service is important.,0
"If you are looking for authentic Chinese food, this isn't the place.  If you are looking for well made food with generous portions, you have come to the right place!",0
"Good Pho, but paying almost 10 dollars for a large pho in AZ is ridiculous.  Pho is cheaper in Hawaii and Hawaii is expensive.",0
Richard had great customer service and accommodated our needs.,0
The food here is just good not great.  Pricing is great for the large portions of food.  Overall a good experience.,0
If you choose to go with the mexican side of the menu its disgusting. Everything is slop on a plate. No one should come here and pay these prices.,0

A nice diner; better than Denny's.\nCan't go wrong.\nGood service service.,0

Very slow service. Food is typical for BK.,0

It was so so.  I actually prefer Einstein Brothers Bagels.,0
"This place is great! The burgers are amazing and the coleslaw is fantastic. 4 stars because it's pretty pricey, but worth it for a fabulous meal.",0
I went to the restaurant for dinner and ordered the sea bass.  It was delicious and it came with a side order of vegetables. I really like this place and will return in the future.,0
"My husband and I both ordered pasta, and we both ended up with food poisoning, the sauce was super salty and, something was cross contaminated or under cooked for as sick as we both ended up.",0
I ordered a Caesar Salad to go.  Never have I a paid 9.00 for a worst salad. I was unaware the Greeks use brown old lettuce and Romaine,0

"Great place to grab a drink after work with friends that isn't corporate or pricey.  Just laid back, friendly people.",0
"Very solid Mexican restaurant.  Decent prices, good food, great margaritas.",0
Had a very disappointing breakfast. The french toast actually comes with toast. Really? The French toast and bacon came out cold. This is more of a coffee place is a breakfast place.,0
Got a hot tea for a little under $2. Line moved pretty quick and staff was helping to keep things organized despite a busy location.,0
"This is a mall, and they have stuff you can buy. Usually crowded on the weekends by people that don't know how to get the hell out of your way.",0
Radio Shack does not honor the manufacture warranty unless you purchase the extended warranty from Radio Shack.  I will NEVER purchase anything from Radio Shack again and recommend that you don't either!,0

"One of the best deli's in Phoenix. Great food all around. Everyone is so nice and friendly, definitely worth a visit!",0

"This is a comic book store.  Great people who are very knowledgeable about past, present, and near future comics.  Always helpful and willing to find what you want.",0
I love the Goat Yogurt.. oh and their goats milk is the cheapest. The brown eggs are like farm eggs from home. Thank you Trader Joe's,0

Just don't waste your time driving out to this one... Wigwam location is better..,0

I am often a regular of Jerry's. The staff aways takes are of us and we feel comfortable and happy. Thanks!,0

Great service great food. And the bacon queso fries are my new addiction.,0

Cultureless chain restaurant with bland food. Employees are more interested in flirting with each other at the host stand than to acknowledge you when you walk in or walk out.,0

My stuff was stolen from my room. Management and staff unhelpful and unapologetic. Going to file a police report.,0

"I was not at impressed with the Macaroons. The flavor was not as \""fresh\"" as I would have like. The saving grace at time was the Breton. Burnt Almond torte was ok.",0
"The food overall is just ok, but the bakery is very good.",0
"The food is just ok... A little over priced compared to what you get. WIll choose a better steakhouse, at the same price point, before coming here again... very disappointed in quality, portion size, and price point.",0
My favorite bar. I moved away and it closed.\nSad,0
"HUGE selection, fantastic customer service (very patient and friendly) and prices are pretty good. Keep it up guys!",0
"It was rough, real rough. My blood pressure just skyrocketed from purchasing some concrete and rope. Grrr.",0
This place is awesome. What I think an old fashioned supper club would be like.  Huge bar and lots of seating.  The cheese curds are delicious and the fish fry is a must order! Good parking too.,0
"Such a cool place, everyone is really nice and the bartenders are super fun! They have a lot of events!! Would totally recommend if people are looking for a local bar!",0
Not too busy mid-day. Lots of indoor and outdoor seating.,0

Go here. Eat one of each of the macarons. Ignore the price. Change your life!!!,0
We saw the original owner was back so we figured we would try out the pizza.  We were very disappointed in the food. We will not be going back.,0
"Good, cheap diner food. They have all the diner classics served whatever time of day you crave them aaaand they have a bar.",0
"I was so looking forward to going to this restaurant.  It has a nice view of a man-made pond, but the food is barely average.  If the ambience wasn't so nice, it would get only 2 stars.",0
They just lost my money cause no one would ask if I needed help. Waste of my time.,0
"I also found her rude, unwilling to answer questions.",0
The food was delocious and the service was great,0

This little Mexican restaurant is a favorite of the locals. Service is always friendly fast and professional. The food is always consistent and priced right. Great place for a large group.,0
"The al pastor tacos taste like a SLIM JIM. \n\nThe sope was good, the rice had an interesting flavor, and the beans were runny. The salsa was decent.",0
Well the waitress was really nice and was working hard.    But she had to do the place on her own.   Food came out cold.   :(,0
"Feels like your lost in a third world country, nothing but garbage.",0
"It's like a blue Home Depot, just backwards.",0
Great shop. Very open layout and friendly staff. Sometimes parking can be difficult though as it is a small shared lot.,0
The food was great. Although customer service is a bit fuzzy but over all I like this place. They kept me coming back =D,0
Food is very good. Lots of choices on the menu. Staff is very friendly. Definitely will be going back often.,0
The food here is usually good. Pizza is fabulous! Eggplant was from freezer n def not fresh. Sauce is decent but from now on will only order pizza....,0
Mystery Theater was cute and funny. Food was aweful and very bland.,0
"I was craving a burger & decided to try Sonic.  It was so good, I will be back again.  Yummy for my tummy!",0
Competent Italian food in downtown Madison. Had the mozzarella di buffalo salad and penne puttanesca along with a glass of Chianti. Quite good and reasonable prices.,0
"Hands down the worst bar I've been to in Arizona. The place was filthy and full of only men. I went there with my sister and we were pretty uncomfortable, to say the least. Not my scene at all.",0
Best bang for your buck Buffet and delicious too. I take all my friends there and they agree it was the best buffet to start the Vegas experience.,0
This is our favorite Chinese restaurant. The food is delicious and the price is right. They are fast and always quite friendly.,0
I was looking for a great steakhouse in Charlotte! I know longer have to look any further. Between the delicious anniversary steak dinner and the best wait staff; Morton's is my favorite place.,0
"Service was good and I didn't need to wait long for my pedicure. My biggest issue is that credit cards are *not* accepted. Get a square, please!",0
Some prices you can't beat! All other prices... You can! Lol,0
Loved the food! The service was also really good! The waiter made great suggestions when we asked and was knowledgeable and very helpful! Can't wait to go back!,0

"Edible, but nothing to write home about.  Had a taco salad, pretty generic, not much flavor",0
Great theater!!! Absolutely beautiful.. Live the seating... Seen Book of Mormon here!!! Loved it,0
Make sure you leave AMPLE time to get to and from the airport. The rental car facility is literally miles from the actual airport. One of the furthest I've been to.,0
"we are now seasoned veterans from cincinnati, its the only place we know of when we are working in scottsdale.",0
"Always kinda half empty store... The one at Desert Ridge is a bit better and cleaner, Happy Valley one is good too.",0

Confusing airport.   Seriously confusing out of a lot of airports that I've been to.,0
"My family always has fun when we come here, pizza is ok, appetizers are better and desert is good! The entertainment is always fantastic, the downside...cash only",0
"Nice enough furniture. Salesmen pretty friendly. Not the highest end furniture but as the saying goes, \""you get what you pay for\"".",0
"GREAT coffee, horrendously slow service with other employees not interested in helping knock down the line. If you are just getting coffee, hit the drive-thru - you'll be less frustrated.",0
They met my tight time line for two dresses i needed on the weekend. even called and gave me the time i could pick them up. very efficient and friendly bunch.,0
I hadn't been to Kohls in years and I either forgot what a dump it was or it's declined over the years. Regardless it was a huge disappointment and I will be going to Steinmart for these needs for now on.,0
The tools are cheap but sometimes that's all you need. The people here are nice and fairly helpful. I would go back.,0
The lamb kabob was cooked perfectly. Tabooleh and falafel were fantastic. Finished off with knafeh. Must try!,0
At AJ's you can buy fresh baked pizza. Try it. It's honestly one of best pizza's you will ever have. \nStaff is very nice. Overall great experience.,0

"Not my favorite at all, it was just ok. I would like to try the buffet though. I just did not think the flavors were all there.",0
"Gross.  Typical greasy, low quality Mexican food.  If it's all you can afford Buon Appetite.",0
"Fantastic service, great fish, all around a great place to grab sushi.",0
I too got the 2 slice and a drink deal.  I had the pineapple and ham pizza slices.  The sauce had a nice tang to it and I got ham and pineapple in every bite.  A good lunch deal.,0
Just meh. Ordered chicken satay and yellow curry chicken to go. the place was empty and my order was made quickly. but the flavors were just meh.,0
Dr Sosinsky the best! Has helped me soooo much with my MS. Thank You!,0
"I think this place is rated 4 stars because of all the hungover hipsters in Plaza, and waffle house isnt close by. Nothing special, and it's cash only.",0
"The wings were good, but the pork porterhouse was very dry. Also, the sirloin my daughter got was cooked properly and very tough.",0
"Great place to catch a summer dog. Good food, fast which is amazing given how popular they are and they have a fair amount of variety on their menu.",0
"Nice hotel, front desk could be more helpful. Not many perks for the price. Rooms very clean and spacious. Beautiful building. Very very close to Consol energy",0
I can make BBQ at home in my slow cooker. If you want good BBQ go to Smokey Jon's not a chain restaurant.,0
"Just had a chicken bean and rice burrito, not the best Iv'e had.  getting sick of all these mexican places tasting the same (see Robertos)",0
Probably the best Italian food I have had so far the in the valley. Our waiter was very friendly as well. This is more of a spot to bring your significant other then a group full of kids.,0
Hard to tell which was colder: my beer or my burrito. The service was non-existent. And had to beg for chips and salsa. Skip this one.,0
The best Mexican restaurant in the area that very few know about.,0
Very dated but clean. Fine for a one night stop on road trip. Free coffee in morning & cookies at night. Bathroom tiny!,0
"Super duper friendly service, but I am here to eat, and it is mediocore food at best.",0
"This place is terrible, they opened a crappy cafe, everything tastes of cardboard.  The bathrooms are completely disgusting. The employees are lazy and rude, especially curly haired older guy.  Avoid this place like the plague",0
Absolutely love their brisket sandwich!\nNothing compares to this sandwich. But I wish they were open until later for those late night cravings!,0
Everyone here is cooler than a polar bears toe nails. Everyone very helpful and the old man there knows everything about everything.,0
Had delivery last night and it was TERRIBLE!\nI threw the menu away,0
one of the worst steak sandwiches i've ever eaten. there were 7 of us and the only people who liked their food were the kids and the one who had the pizza. \n\ni would never eat here again,0
I've been three times and the food has been great.  Seems no one knows how good this place really is.  Great undiscovered Italian food for locals.,0
"The service was very friendly, but the food wasn't all that good. Most everything tasted like it had been sitting around for quite a while before being plated. Especially the potatoes. Not sure I would return.",0
"This is a very decent airport with a good variety of shopping and eating. In terms of drop-off and pick-up, this is definitely one of the easier airports to navigate.",0
This is my girlfriend first  time here. We ordered the ham and cheese and bacon 6in it was very good. We will return.,0
"Great, fresh subs...but the sourdough was kinda hard. Nice employees!!",0

Went there tonight.\n\nWorst Sushi I have ever had.,0
"Every time my boyfriend and I eat here, it has been great. We really enjoy the steamed dumplings and hot and sour soup. The staff is very friendly, too.",0
Bar is okay and the atmosphere is nice.  Food is below average and pricey. Our food was cold and when we commented on that the sever didn't seem to care.,0
Best phone in town! Always piping hot  made with love and a great menu. Check it out. You will not be disappointed,0
Went there once and the fish was old and felt rubbery with a room temperature feel. Maybe I went on a bad day but it was enough to ruin it for me,0
"I love feeling like a queen for the day. One tech at my feet, one doing my nails.  And I definitly recommend getting gel nails.  It looks great and lasts long.",0
"The Nugget is probably my favorite place to stay, why? because it cost as much as the Concha Inn but has the style and class of any hotel on the strip. In terms of comfort and style, I consider the cost inexpensive.",0
Fresh and tasty. No two dishes taste alike and they are always efficient getting orders together. I just wish they delivered!,0
"Fantastic seating, not a bad seat in the house.  Plus there's fantastic eats!",0
"Seems like a good crowd.  Very chill.  Cool signs, but the atmosphere is lacking.",0
This restaraunt has from line employers who have visible tattoos.  Disgusting.  They do not care about professionalism or cleanliness of the employees.,0
Staff sucks! Dislike this store alot. Long lines. Unhelpful staff! I prefer oreilys!,0
Good place to watch a game but the food is terrible.  Went there about four times and had to send the food back every time because it was cold!,0
"This place, like all other downtown places, smell like piss and bums.  No thanks.",0
"Been there three times in 2 years, always disappointed by the quality of both food and service.",0
Very disappointed tonight. Ordered a special pizza that wasn't on the pizza bar and it was never delivered. Manager was too busy texting on his cell phone to once walk around the restaurant. Poor service.,0
Great fun. Enjoy the live blues bands that come through. There is even dancing which is fun. Small intimate feel.,0
Great food! Clean. Basic. Friendly staff and reasonably priced. What more do you need?,0
$5.25 for one 12oz can of tecate beer.,0

"The best Italian we've found in Mesa yet. The Veal was amazing as was the gnocci. Order some wine, sit on the patio and stay late. A great place to bring a date.",0
"Flowers stunk to high heaven with all the chemicals they sprayed on them to try to make dead flowers look fresh. It didn't work, they looked like dead flowers. Absolutely the worst bouquet I've ever bought. Don't bother.",0
Everyone is friendly & professional;  especially the two most important ie: dentist and hygienist.  Definitely recommend this office.,0
All you can eat salad.  But I like my own dressing....there ranch. Just isn't right.,0
Good eggs.\nGood french toast.\nGood chorizo n' egg scramble.\nGood cinnamon roll.\nGood service.\nGood patio shade.\nGood price.\nGood choice.,0

"Good Burger, and Great Service.\nThe Arizona Peach Ale is my favorite!",0
"Dr Patty is the best, love her she is like family",0

"There pizza is ok, Nooot New York style the slice is too thick.",0
Found  hair in my food.  BLECH!!  Never ever again!,0
One time I was there it took them about 15 minutes to just get someone to the cash register come on! I eventually just left.,0
Whitest Chinese food you'll ever eat! Still pretty good though.,0
"It's kind of divey but the buffalo wings are amazing, I recommend the good ol Irish experience",0
Food was average at best when you consider the price.  Our table had a broken leg being held up by a plate and portions of food were extremely small,0
Does this place still exist?  I drove around this area for 15 minutes looking and the best I can gather is that this Lowe's got converted into a Steinmart.  Lame.,0
"I was here last night for the Mosaik ballet.  Gotta love this old, nicely restored theatre.  It's a classic and I enjoy attending performances here every time.",0
"Great Food, Great Service. Better for Date Night than dinner with 5 Kids. Not Kid \""unfriendly\"" just not kid friendly if you get my drift. Oh, did I mention they have GREAT FOOD?",0
Nothing outstanding to report. Seemed to be the same as most other Applebee's around town.,0
Jeff was awesome! Made us feel very welcome.,0
This place is still open because the snowbirds don't know what real Mexican food is all aabout and there is no where else in AJ to eat.  If you have a car there is no reason to eat here at all.,0
they do a really good job on my nails. plus they are close to home and work...and if anything no need for an appt...it seems i come in with almost no waiting...im a happy camper.,0
Huevos Rancheros was great for breakfast. Friendly service and reasonably priced. Would go back in a heartbeat.,0

Store is always fully stocked and clean.\n\nThey finally got the mini Starbucks area finish and open!!,0

Awful place. Extremely loud and unpleasant and the food is close to not being edible.,0
"This place is so horrible, with the Air conditioning being so hot out side they must keep it at 80 degrees, The restrooms are GROSS and uncleaned...",0

Great place for a burger and a quick lunch.,0
"Tried the new Kobe burger, just as tasty as the other burgers.",0
Great filled doughnuts.  We used to get a box of these every Friday night at work (I worked second shift).   Good memories.,0
Free tortilla chips and salsa are the best part. The margaritas are about average and the enchilladas are ok. The price is right and the decor is good but I've had better.,0
Best wings ever!!!! There is no place that can stand near this place for wings.,0
"You can never go wrong when it comes to the quality of Capriotti's sandwiches.  Excellent customer service, food is prepared in a timely manner and it tastes great!",0

"Very pushy! I went with my mother who is fighting cancer, I was shocked at how pushy they were with her. They are taking advantage of cancer patients.",0
I treat myself to this every once in a while as an indulgence.  Food is fabulous. Best Philly Cheese steak in Arizona.  Always fresh ingredients and they ship in specialty items in from Pennsylvania.,0
I had so much fun! Very nice people and the trail was so peaceful. I would defiantly go again.,0
Got sick from here...My food came out in about 30 seconds.  I should have known.,0
The food was very good but beware the take home packs of soy sauce! They are not soy sauce but colored salt water.  Not the thing I expected from this restaurant.,0
"Service was not very good took to long to get our meals about 45 minutes and the dessert we ordered never came just promises that it would, we finally got tired of waiting after an additional 45 minutes of promises, we will not be going back.",0
Too many birds on the back patio.  It's to bad because the view is wonderful.,0
"Ok for the family, but I would not go out of my way to come back.",0
"If you like dog food, then go to this lousy place for food.",0
There is only about 4 pieces of meat about the size of my thumbnail in my Hakata bowl. So disappointing.,0
Ordered for delivery and after an hour and a half without my food I drove down and was told they had not even started my order. NEVER GO TO THIS RESTAURANT.,0
SUCH Terrible food NEVER AGAIN sooo disappointing,0

"Excellent NY style pizza!!!  The wings are great too!!!  The place is spotless and the manager (Eric) has the place running like a fine-tuned machine.  Not the best area, but worth the trip!!!",0
It used to be really good but not anymore.  Sorry guys! :(,0

I love the atmosphere at the Farm (when it's not too hot) and the food is pretty darn good every time I've gone.  The downsides are it's a little pricy and gets pretty crowded when it's nice out.,0
"Whenever I am there, I always feel welcomed by the staff and I have never had a problem with service.  The food good and the atmosphere is fun.",0
On our way out of Vegas stopped for the night at a nasty hotel(not here)...all was erased when we checked out the buffet as,0

"Called for a cab and the driver that called was at the wrong location. Called back, told someone was on the way, 30 minutes and nothing. Complete waste of time and would never call back.",0
We ordered pizza today for lunch in our dental office.  The doctor was eating and a piece of glass was in the pizza.  They offered to return the money never did.  I don't recommend going to this store.,0
I go here because the prices are the best around and it's close to home. I've found that the later you go the stranger the crowd gets!,0

Very nice lunch spot. Fresh food and drinks and nice staff. I will return in the near future and strongly recommend.,0

Good enough place to get comfort food. Nothing special but gets the job done.,0
Holy Moly!  Best Cuban sandwich I've ever had!! Thank you bartender Jim for the recommendation.. \n\nNever disappointed at Karsen's..,0

Pizza is ok pasta ok wings ok salads ok \nService sucked one of them was mean to my sis when she worked there but she doesn't anymore. Enjoy if your going,0

Friendly and delicious! It's like having a friend for breakfast.,0
I have had very poor experiences dealing with this business.  Period.,0

BBQ is good; great flavor in the rub for the meats.  I would not choose a non meat item.  My wife had the catfish and it was so so.  Service was really friendly and fast.,0
The atmosphere is about the only redeeming quality for Chicago Joe's. The food is just a notch above the chain Italian restaurants but the service deserves only one star. Our waiter showed little concern for his guests.,0

"The Howie bread was excellent, the pizza was ok....  too much sauce, causing it to be soggy, but still pretty good",0

"Tried a green smoothie, the apple and greens. My smoothie was way to icy, i had to ask them to blend it again. Next time, I'll just order my goto here, the mango-a-gogo.",0
Food was ok. Fries seemed like they were done already when we got them. Ostrich burgers were excellent though. Bar Tender at the time was somewhat condescending. Draft Beer was kinda warm. Sam the waitress was nice.,0
"Always impressed with the service, food, and variety.  They win!",0
It had no taste. Ordered many different things and was left unsatisfied.,0
In my opinion Best Buy does not care about people in wheelchairs. Sorry I cannot shop there anymore. I been treated like dirt.,0

Broke down and they were honest and straight forward and showed me what broke in my car. I recommend them highly.,0
Sharon the cashier that waited on us was fantastic.,0
You CANNOT go to Vegas & not stop by this place.  It's as iconic of a place then any of the casinos.  Place is HUGE w/ anything you'd ever want.,0
"Had some pretty good wines. Look out for the cherry though, It taste like cough syrup",0
"Got some caps that saved our faces in Utah, but go here for good show and local advice! Very friendly crew. Wished we would have done that sooner...",0
Menu is rather small soft serve is So so prices are reasonable. Service not very friendly. Very small interior with limited seating. If your In the area I would opt for Page dairy mart instead.,0

"upon entry it is immediately evident this is a 'pee anywhere' establishment, complete w/ pee pee scented pint glasses. stay away from the black & yellow.",0
Service was terrible. Food wasn't the greatest either. There are a lot better Mexican restaurants on the area.,0
This place used to be one of my favorite places to go. All the food is authentic chinese made cooked by chinese. The portions are more than generous with good prices. Visit this place you won't be disappointed..,0
I've been here and ordered the ribs. They're pretty good. Nothing really stand out. The red velvet cake is pretty good though.,0
"Long wait, good food, good beer. Nice atmosphere, bit over priced.  Service was just okay.",0
Wow it was 15$ to fax 13 pages had I known that i def wouldn't Hv done it. Save your money Ppl buy a fax. Just ridiculous!,0
Ordered the chicken bowl and the chicken was extremely dry. The rice and sauce was okay.,0
"One great bar! They always pour them strong and quick, always a plus. Great place to hang with a few friends. Come for the booze stay for the free darts and local flavor",0
I love Noodles but this location is going downhill fast. They undercook/ overlook my chicken every time. They are also getting good at under boiling noodles!,0
I would rather poke my own eye out than take my kid here again. Srsly depressing.,0
"I walked in and then straight back out.  Also, there was an attack in the parking lot involving a hammer.",0
"Hostess was awful, but the waitress was nice! It's dead here and the food was awful. Will not be back. Such a shame because the location is great!",0
"Food was decent for what it is.\n Generous portions,friendly counter guy.\nPlace probably would fail a health inspection thou.\nNever going back!",0
"This is the bar where you walk in with $25 bucks and walk out not remembering the night. A true classic dive bar! Good times, which is usually based on who you are with.",0
Darrell and his staff helped me make the most beautiful custom necklace for my wife  commemorating the birth of our first son.,0
A great little place. Delicious and affordable Italian food. Great salads and pasta. Try the pizza rolls!,0
Amazing. Try the 2 slice and drink meat special on Fridays,0
"food quality a 4, server attitude 2 so averaged at 3. said thank you after drink delivery no response repeated thank you at food delivery still no response, finally spoke when delivering check. Chips and Salsa are a 5!",0
Bring cash only. Good for an after dinner drink.,0
I've eaten here for quite some time. We enjoy the teriyaki with a bit of spice. I can't recall a bad experience with or food and the lady at the counter is nice.,0
Stay away!!!!!! The waiters/waitresses hate you and your hapiness.,0
"We stayed 3 nights and the place was empty for the most part.  It's starting to look a bit tattered, unkept.",0
"Favorite dive bar. Get the dise burger - awesome! Cheap beer and drinks, very divy, so not for the faint of heart.",0
It is the typical old school sonoran mexican joint. Nothing wowed me. Tamale was close to hormel from a can. Taco was good.,0
"I have eaten almost everything on the menu at least twice I think.  Bloody Mary, hurricanes are well done and there is a good beer selection. High quality food in a relaxed setting.",0
Terrible bar. If you're not a regular you get ignored. The staff is not attentive at all and when asked to order a drink looked annoyed. Don't come here unless you love bad service.,0
I know this is a brewery but no air conditioning in the summer in Arizona? The bear was good the service was okay and the atmosphere was hot as hell and I would never go back there in the summer.,0
"I'm a fan of Italian food. And I'm willing to pay for good Italian food. Not that Lidia's isn't good. It is. But I've had better for less $$, like Piccolo Forno in Lawrenceville.",0
It's a sandwich I could've made at home but I am not home and I need to eat lunch.,0
Service here is going down hill fast at this store!,0

Fantastic food. Great atmosphere and service.  I forgot to ask what wine the waitress brought me but I really liked it. I will defiantly come back.,0

Great service good food.  Not fabulous but good.,0
fun place to hang out for drink on friday and sat nights.,0
"The place is a ripoff. Two eggs, sausage, hash browns for 12.70. In Vegas, off the strip, REALLY.",0
"The subs are good, the bread is fresh, and they deliver late.  This is a great combination in my book!  The prices are good and they have a lot of different kinds of subs.  They do lack in side dishes.",0
Saigon Palace doesn't stack up to Ben Thanh or Pho Hoa but I do think they're better than Saigon grill up the street so if you're on South blvd and need some Vietnamese I'd come here instead.,0
"My first time eating here... Oh my goodness... why would anyone eat here food is gross.  worst chicken  ever, it was like rubber.",0
Fries were over salted the last 3 times. Very disappointing for me because I generally love Wendy's.  If you can avoid the fries odds are the are extremely salty.,0
Really dig this place. The cornbread is addicting and the menu is diverse. Never had a problem here and the service is usually spot-on.\n\nRobert Pfeifer,0
The restaurant is beautiful and the service is just OK.  The food is nothing special and I don't see any reason to choose this restaurant again.,0
"The past couple of times I've been here service has been slow, mainly because there are only 2 waitresses working. The food is pretty good for reasonable prices. They also have different specials for each day of the week.",0
Pretty good bagels for Arizona.  Definitely remind me of New York bagels.,0
"It's cool because it's a big time dive. The food is ok. The shells are deep fried, but the guts are very boring. Overall it's ok and the prices are ok. It's worth going once...twice max.",0
A good place to have some really good burritos. Place is neat and has a good atmosphere. Price is decent enough. Not much to expect here though.,0
"Food was good, but not great.  Service was fantastic, but atmosphere was only so-so.  Get the Mac and cheese",0
Actually one of the best airports I've been too. \nWould I go back? Hell yeah? \nAnytime soon? Hell no.,0
First time having Afternoon tea time in the States. This place is very beautifully decorated. We had the Earl Grey and peach ginger tea. They were really good and the tea stand was AMAZING,0
"Just ok. The cheese curds are delicious. The beer is just average. The pretzel is  not a pretzel, it's bread with salt on it, shaped like a pretzel.",0
"Good prices for happy hour, appetizers and drinks.  Service is average, food is average as well.  Good spot if just want something to eat and you are in the area.",0
They were very helpful in finding the leak that I had and was very professional.,0

"My Children loves this place. if there's a special occasion, you know that all they want is this place....AWESOME....Steak and the bread yummy.",0
"A nice cozy place with respect to the environment but other than this nothing impressive. Food selection and imagination is poor, while the ingredients seem not to be fresh at all. Service is decent.",0
Freaking out a little. Just got finished eating there. Hairs in the food and I saw a cockroach crawl across the kitchen floor. At least if I get sick tonight I will know why!,0
"Expensive, but always has the printer cartridges I need in stock, so really can't complain.",0
superbe terrasse au bord du jardin des fontaines.;tr\u00e9s romantique..;bonne cuisine un peu spicy,0

"Not clean, room sure could use a coat of paint and updating.",0
"Terrible food, terrible prices, terrible service. I'll never eat here again or order room service from the stratosphere hotel since this is the kitchen that supplies it.",0
Nice place to visit in spring time frame.  The prices are affordable and the views are breathtaking.,0
So terrible.\nEverything... besides the hotcakes.,0
"best mongolian beef anywhere, swear....",0

"Nice bar all bottle beers, pool tables and excellent prices. The free popcorn is so good and a must have are the honey chicken sliders 100 times better then white castle.",0
"My brother just moved into the neighborhood and we love Dorn's! For a small store they seem to have whatever we need, and they are so so helpful!",0
"This place used to be good, but that was years ago.\n\nToday it's very dirty with food that just doesn't cut it.\n\nThe salsa is still good so that gave it a star.",0
Nothing special. The Mekong Palace still better but this is my second dim sum. Still looking..,0
Great place.   Too many choices of omlettes to chose from.  People r friendly and it's affordable.   Food is great too.  And they have a balloon lady for the kids.,0
This place has NEVER gotten our order right.  Not once.  Lame.,0
I really don't know what the hype is about.  I was quite underwhelmed with this restaurant.,0
Went during lunch time and serve was extremely slow.,0
The place was decent and so was the food.  I especially liked the potato salad as a side dish.,0
"This location is great.  We have been here a couple times, both with big and small parties and each time we were waited on quickly and our food was great.",0
The food was great the service was average. I ordered an appetizer a big salad and a meal all top notch. Everything was cooked properly and delicious I can't wait to be back.,0
Absolutely nothing wrong with this mall. It's a mall as you know it :),0
Take a downtown hotel. Move it to the South end of the strip. Fill with Hooters waitress rejects from six states. Offer $3 blackjack. Invite douchebags. Profit.,0
Great place to have some Chicago Style Baby Back Ribs!,0

"A decent steak in a location that is in dire need of an update.  Also, a nice and denser then average creme brulee.",0
Great guacamole and salsa. The tacos were great. So much better than La fiesta. Fast and Friendly service. They also have a tortilla maker as well. Pretty neat.,0
"Your standard sports bar fare, reasonably priced and served with a smile.  Good for a beer and a sandwich while watching a game.",0
"Reminds me of a place back in Chicago me and my wife would eat at. Looking forward to the happy hour there, as the deals looked pretty good, and the food was excellent. Really liked it.",0

"Best late night place to eat after a night of partying and whatevers.  Good food, nuff said.",0

Lots of food and grease. Enuff said.,0
My cousin recommended this place. Its ok.\n\nI had half of Cotton Candy and the other was Creme Brulee.,0
Not too crazy about this place. I ordered a pastrami on rye and it was just a pile of meat on soggy bread.,0
"The band, the bar, the atmosphere was the most fun we had in old town. Imagine country red neck band playing neil diamond covers. Too much fun!!",0
"Cool place- nice outside bier garden, live music, tons of craft beers.",0
Pleasant evening on the patio with average good but a friendly waitress. They have malt vinegar for the fish and chips.,0
This place could definitely use an interior upgrade. Went on a weekday and parking and seating not so busy/packed. The experience is fun which is why I gave it a 3. Food is so-so but nothing special.,0
Being a valley native I have had my share of Mexican food. Sonoran is my fav and this little place does it up right. Great service and excellent red chili,0
"Over Rated and to crowded.  Go to Mi Patio or La Canasta instead.  Or, go a little further north to Via Delosantos for even better food and drinks!",0
Met some friends here one night who frequent the place. It's a great dive bar with good food and a great prices. \n\nBreakfast is great and good music.,0
"OK airport. Layout is fine - food choices vary across terminals; in mine, not great choices. Clean & bright. Conveniently located to suburbs around Phoenix. It works -",0
Good Pizza nice menu. Tried this place after seeing a yelp deal. Had a free slice waiting for my pie.,0
Amazing staff and great wine selection!  One of my favorite places to relax on any night. Live music on Friday an Saturday!,0
Great food and service. Wine prices are reasonable and they have some very good wine available. Owners are always onsite and available to say hello and just check that all is well. Music a few nights a week but same guy all the time.,0
Great staff and absolutely wonderfu dentist.  I do not enjoy the dentist one bit but Dr. Garhardt made me very comfortable and he's very personable.  Love this office and I never imagined myself saying this about a dentist office.,0
Small little bar in a strip mall. Good place for beer and watching the games. Nothing fancy. Kareoke on weekends if your into that. A couple of regulars are always there.,0
Called and found out Rob's gone!  So gave them another whirl and service on my bike couldn't have been better.,0
This place is disgusting its so dirty and all the food was dried out and I got a salad and there was a huge hair in it I've never had a good experience here its over priced for mediocre food,0
I like german food and good German beer. Penn Brewery had both Their Penn Dark is GREAT.,0
Sunday breakfast: website says the bar opens at 8am.  Actually opens at 9am on Sunday. The service is terrible. But the bloody bar is fun and they have really good burgers.,0
What ever is on the special board is what you want in your mouth!!!,0

"I found a lot to do in this airport while waiting for a flight to San Antonio. \n\nThe wifi is fast, if you're into that kinda stuff.",0
We love the popcorn here. Sometimes the picture isn't the greatest for the theater but overall we love to go here and get rewarded for our movie going so that is fun.,0

Nothing beats a bean and cheese with both red and green salsa.,0
"Yes I am still a fan.\nSitting in my room right now and learned that if you care to have quiet DO NOT LET THEM GIVE YOU A ROOM WITH A CONNECTING DOOR,,,, EEEE GADS.",0
Irritating beeping behind the line for at least 3 minutes while we waited 6 minutes to get our coffee,0
The Staff is VERY rude the manager is even ruder kept talking over me then slammed the door.. stay away from this location.,0
Excellent barbecue. The meat has a smoky flavor. Nice country atmosphere,0
"Didn't answer the phone the first time. The second time they answered to tell me they were closed, despite me calling at 1pm which is during their business hours.\n\nI'll spend my money else where.",0
Third time I've gotten sick after eating here....never again!,0

"Low quality food! and as far as drinks, I ordered Ecstasy martini and I couldn't even drink it. It tasted really weird and I had to send it back. One good point though was they took that out of my bill.",0
"I have been in search of good food for breakfast and kept getting this place as a recommendation. However, after visiting I thought the food was not as good as even a IHOP. I wouldnt go back or travel for this place",0
"I would never stay here again, i would rather not go to vegas if this was my only choice. Everything is old, rooms, AC, elevators, wings.",0
Can't do all you can eat by yourself. Seems unfair to pay more for just a single item on the menu when I couldn't get someone to join me and get the 15.99 price.,0
"Comfy chairs, great selection at the concession stand, and decent prices. What more is there to love?",0
the bread...the bread...the bread.  \n\neat it and be happy.,0
This place has excellent breakfast. The biscults and gravy are amazing. Fresh coffee. The parking is a little small for full size trucks. Home style breakfast is a speciality here.,0
Only bar downtown Madison I can think of that has air hockey.  For that it gets a star.,0
My friends and I still call it 'Los' and it's my favorite burrito spot. Bean & cheese burrito is the best ever but the entr\u00e9es are legit too.,0
I had the spinach dip and it was not good at all. Followed by the Turkey Pesto sandwich. That was just OK. That atmosphere was great though a very cute place.,0
"I'm a Fan because they fixed my Flat for free, which is standard for Discount Tire. For me FREE is always good.",0
It's horrible pizza. Order four large pizzas and out of the four times I have gone the pizza is extremely greasy. If you like greasy pizza then go for it but its horrible.,0
Waiter lacked ability to serve properly very disappointed overall left with a second waiter so far not much better,0
I work near by and decided to check it out.  This mall is horrible. Sorry I will stick to my Kierland and Biltmore!,0

I had the egg noodle soup with wontons and shrimp.  It was good!,0
"If you are a pizza person. like me, this is okay chain pizza.",0

"Great food, never had a bad meal there.  I love that they get their desserts from Signature Desserts.",0
"well, that was fast! my sandwich was made before i even finished paying.\n\nThe bread wasn't anything to write home about. \n\n\nThe whole experience was simple, fast, and easy.",0
"Do not even think  about it. After seeing tv ads decided to try the chicken. Wrong, dry, old but the staff was having was having a great  time, quality was not a concern.",0
Run of the mill steak and seafood at high end prices.  Service mediocre.  Stay at home rather than spend your money here. Not really worth a lengthy review.,0
Didn't think anyone could ruin chicken strips and Fries but they sure did tonight.  Strips were burnt and fries you could nearly crack a tooth on. But the ranch was excellent,0
Yaki Tacos were yucky! Skimpy on the teryaki and dry. The fries were hard and cold. Place is going down hill fast. I wont eat here again! WOOF!!,0
Room was pretty clean. Towels smelled bad. Could feel every spring in the bed and pillows were a joke. Whole place smelled of stale smoke. Gave it 2 stars since it was in a good area and sheets seemed clean.,0
"Not bad for a Hotel Bar.  Plenty of beer options but the food should only be eaten in a pinch.  Typical bar food burgers, nachos and chicken fingers, just pricey for the Quality.",0
"Breakfast food is excellent, so is the service and restaurant.",0
"Biscuits and gravy with sausage patty is top notch, and the soda didn't taste funky like in so many places.   It's incredible how lousy the service is every single time.  But I will be back.",0
This was a nice little mexican restaurantt.  Had good food.  Menus were large and plentyful.  Price was reasonable.  Staff was friendly.  Can't really complain about it.,0

"They have the best penne pasta with marinara sauce and the garlic bread is to die for! Very consistent, always tastes just how I remember. I LOVE this place!! Awesome service. Super nice people. 5 stars!",0
"Great service and even better soul food. Try the fried green tomatoes, Mac and cheese, collards, catfish and fried chicken.",0
"Looking over my credit card statement, I see they charged me more than I signed for. Guess I didn't leave a big enough tip.",0
"Great thin crust pizza, good local brews on tap. Would have given this another star if it wasn't for the 90 min wait for a table.",0
"Kitchen was very slow, all food did not come at same time 15 minutes from the first delivery of food until the last person got there. The food was extremely over cooked and cold \n\nWould never come back",0
Delicious prickly pear and boysenberry although a little too sweet.  Live music.  Comfortable.,0
I went in for medication to help eliminate my pimples/acne. The PA gave me some samples but I was not seen by the doctor at all.,0
"The fitting rooms looked like they haven't been cleaned in a while dirty tortillas on the ground...Ok over all, good selection but not the cleanest Target I've been to. (This was the Ahwatukee Target store)",0
Another fantastic place on the east side.  I love to pick up a dozen for my colleagues on my way to work!!!,0
"We actually came to this place because of its reviews on yelp.. We were not disappointed.. Good food, friendly service and best of all good value..",0
The food was greasy. BBQ sauce wasn't good at all. I went to try out their restaurant because the food looked good on triple Ds. Turned out the food wasn't worth the drive,0
they just wanna get rid of you and charge you. worst great clips ever,0
"The lobby is nice and the pool, fitness room are good. Some floors look a bit dated although rooms are just like other Sheratons.",0
order a claypot from the menu it come out different they substitute my chicken to pork spare ribs without telling me,0
"Poor service, with worse food. The only draw is obvious from the name of the restaurant. But that is why we have the internet.",0
Sorry but food was not worth it chicken burrito reminded\n me of why I disliked chicken in the past.,0
"Best Cafe in Pittsburgh - like a hidden gem. The sandwiches are delicious, you must try the chocolate chip brownie, and the coffee is great and made exactly the way you like it.",0
"Awesome spot to grab a dog for a buck. Nothing fancy, must standard ingredients and friendly service.",0
"Another good pizza find in Phoenix. A nice, thicker crust, lots of sauce, and crispy pepperoni. We ordered this in to our hotel room and had a perfect, air-conditioned evening in.",0
"This seems to be my go to place for electronics. This one is close to home and the staff has always been friendly, they have always gone above and beyond to help me out.",0
"Close to home, in a shopping center where not much is affordable. The ice cream is pricey but tasty and the place has a good vibe to it. Peanut butter cup perfection creation is fabulous. Nice kids working there.",0
"Always a great stop for lunch and or dinner, eat here at least 3 times a week. Excellent food and great service.",0
This is heaven for steak lovers like me! High quality and moody...I enjoyed my time very well.,0
"Left them a message to make an appointment--no return call. Went to the Tempe office instead, which was awesome!",0
"Wow, not the place you want to patronize if you like customer service as part of your shopping experience.  That'll teach me for trying to patronize \""the little guy\"". Unfortunately, that's why they are where they are.",0
"Cute reminiscent \""diner \""with an unfortunate corporate feel. The food is good enough for what it is. Cutesy  3/4 attempt at a 50's diner. Not much else to say",0
Most companies charge less than $75 for a diagnostic. Always shop around and get a 2nd opinion.,0
"Gross. Gross. Gross. Pass this place. Service is awful and the food was just as bad. Greasy, low quality slop.",0
"Great food, terrible service - I recommend it only if your eating TO GO.",0
"Prompt service, great pho. I eat pho all the phoking time and this was amazing! the cream cheese wontons and the egg rolls were fairly decent, standard fried stuff.",0
This place is terrible.  \n\nAwful beer selection.  Nice enough (if not braindead) servers.  Nauseating clientele.  \n\nWon't be going back.,0
The restaurant was ok for teh price.  The food was so so. The cat fish was too spicy. The salad was too small for $10.,0
The manager is useless. Machines are broken and never repaired for long periods of time. The only advantage to joining this club is for the hours!!,0
Place is abandoned and locked down. Phone is out of service.  Still merchants inside just no one to sell it.,0
"Arrived and waited for 10 minutes before I grabbed a menu and asked an employee if the guests were supposed to seat themselves.. He responded \""You can\"" and walked by with out furthering assisting me.",0
I got my engagement ring sized and this happened. I received a ring that was a lot thinner and sharp. Now I have small cuts and extremely dry skin which I didn't have before. Sad face!,0
Good food and reasonable prices. My wife loves the place they include miso soup and a little salid with sushi. Nice staff as well,0
Cookies aren't bad.  Haven't had a reason to buy cakes or other pastries.  Staff is friendly and it smells like heaven.,0
"Front desk lady very nice, knew my name as I walked on. That's some good customer service. Inside is clean, coffee, very professional looking.",0
Nine am on a thursday morning and not one piece of toilet paper in the restroom.  Really??? Um yeah I just drank coffee.,0
Walked out after waiting for over 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge we were seated.    The manager walked by twice and did not bother to stop.,0
Lentil soup had barely any lentils n had a grilled cheese sandwich with one maybe 2 slices cheese. Won't bother coming back,0
"Constantly have TV channels go down (Sorry for the interruption, error codes, etc.), internet speed varies or gets throttled down too much, and WAY overpriced.",0
Worst McDonalds in the United States of America. I could get food faster in a prison cell. You have a better chance of the Pope going to hell than getting good service here.,0
They deserve negative stars I heard that there is new owners and it shows from a terrific caterer to a terrible one I've used them for many charitable events it was always on point now I wouldn't recommend them to the dog pound,0
"The service was extremely poor and the staff and management was rude.  I wouldn't go back.  Also, the place was almost dead.",0
nice products but just can't afford their prices so I don't shop there anymore.,0
"Very slow service, had to get our own drink refills. Bathrooms were in need if cleaning. \nBut the food was great.",0
"Some good experiences and some not so good.  Shop around all the dealers, ask questions on all transactions.  Review hours.",0
"Great food. I'm from Boston and this place stacks up with Gyros from the north. Nice people, the place is clean, and open kitchen.",0
Always long lines.  Service is slow.  I think the social hour should be outside on your break not when I am waiting in line.,0
"Are you are really looking at the review for LJS?  Its fried stuff, with extra fried stuff in a cardboard boat.  You will regret eating it 30 minutes after you finish, but it is delicious.",0
Very good average hotel outside of the downtown area.,0
Horrible it's smell horrible it was super dirty worse food experience ever,0
Furniture Affair is awesome! They have a great variety of affordable furniture and accessories that you don't see everywhere else.,0
"Love this place, they are good about describing the different kinds of sushi if you wanna try something different.  any time we have company we go here for your sushi.",0
This is a 100% authentic old-school neighborhood dive bar. Well worth a visit if you're ever in the area. Beer and a shot please!,0
I would not recommend this dentist to anyone. I personally had a terrible experience here and I will never go back. There are way better dentist out there.,0
Best sushi in town! We always come here when sushi is on our mind. Very fresh quality meal.,0
I will no longer buy bagels here anymore. No matter which kind you buy they all taste like an onion/garlic bagel...even the cinnamon sugar!,0
"Seriously? No amphitheater seating?? 1988 called, they want their theatre back.",0
Prices have gone through the roof! I was quoted $350 and then I was handed a $570 bill.,0
I can hear it when my upstairs neighbor pees!  Cheap construction!,0
This Denny's is dirty and hit or miss on the service.  Really needs a remodel and new management.  I dont expect a lot from Denny's in the first place so...,0
This place had some of the best pizza I've ever had. Hands down,0
"We ordered Hot and Sour Soup, Salt and Pepper Prawns and Honey Walnut Shrimp.  It was very good and quite inexpensive. Their dinner selection is more extensive and more authentic than their lunch choices.",0
Great place to get in a cheap poker game.  I love this old style casinos and the patrons they attract.  It's always an interesting time here.  Rooms are pretty cheap too.,0

Convenient and quick.  The prices are reasonable and the people who work here are friendly.  No real complaints.  Check for coupons!,0
Bad food and slow service. Chili was Luke warm. Burgers were raw in middle.,0
"It's bland old white people food, if you like that sort of thing ;) Sort of like a more pricey version of Denny's.",0
Not as great as it used to be but still some of the better Mexican food you'll get in the northwest valley.,0
Great service!\nEven vacuum'd up my crumbs!  ;),0
Had the oil changed in our VW at Kensington today. Friendly and fairly priced. Would definitely recommend them.,0
I ordered the center-cut ribeye for entree. It was delicious. \nThe environment is nice and servers are polite. Recommended.,0
"Service department was more than helpful. I just bought my car from another dealership, but I would not rule out buying the next one here.",0
have been taking our almost 6-year old to Plantation since the day we brought her home from the Humane Society 5 1/2 years ago.  Couldn't ask for better treatment or friendly folks.,0
"Ribs were good, but sauce was a little too sweet.  Review was so close to 4 stars but the corn was cooked in margarine. Really?  Margarine?  C'mon you're in Wisconsin.",0
Nice neighborhood bar.  Food is very ok and certainly is not made by hand.  Nice beer selection.  Many TV's.,0
The people here are very nice and friendly. After I paid I felt as if they were trying to rush me out the door.,0
I agree with previous review. Butter fish was awful.  Onion rings tasted like cardboard.  Thank goodness it was happy hour prices otherwise we would have let the mgr know how awful the food was.  We will never return!,0
Easy to navigate.\nNot too bad compared to the other airports,0
Nice bar to grab food and a beer at. Service from bartenders is mediocre. Atmosphere is Irish-feeling but feels kinda meh,0
"A wise man once told me, \""Don't teach the 'gwei lo' new tricks.\""  I never understood what that meant until I ate here.",0
The place is a dump and the staff is rude and inconsiderate. Avoid this place like the plague...because they have it there.,0
Great staff the stylists have all been there along time and are great with color and cuts.,0
"They make the best shrimp fried and chicken fried rice you'll find in Arizona. The area may be rough, but don't let that deter you from trying their food! Great food and great service!",0
"We were not greeted during the 5 minutes that we browsed the store while the salesmen were on their cellphones behind the counter, so we walked out. Prices of safes 'on sale' were outrageous.",0
My husband and I love having breakfast here.  Such a cute place with delicious food keeps us coming back.  The atmosphere is lively and  it's a nice way to start the day.,0
The coke still has a funny taste. I was hoping after they remodeled that that would be fixed.,0
"On a recent visit, I noticed the Chinese menu was no longer available.  I managed to order one off-menu item but unfortunately it did not taste like it should have. Found the overall experience disappointing compared to previous visits.",0
Over priced sandwiches!!!\nTasteless Flank Steak Sandwich (nothing else) and a bottled coke $16\nSurrounding area with picnic tables was nice though.,0
"Fantastic customer service :)\n\nI said vegetarian sandwich, and he automatically got new gloves and a new knife for me. Actually help me to the beginning to end.",0
Just watched a guy in a SF Giants cap flip burgers with his glove. Gross.,0
The service here is amazing and the food is equally as amazing. The staff is friendly and the space is comfortable. A great place to eat!,0
This bar is cool and hip. Funky and fresh to see something different. The have games and a quaint atmosphere. Huge drinks and cool people. A must see.,0
Good ol' fashioned diner food with friendly service.  Though they could use better coffee from a local roaster.,0
My favorite so far is the Shrimp Bowls. Yummy!,0
"Not only were both of my flights late, they over booked one so 3 people had to give up there seats. I will pay the extra 30 for a different airline next time",0

"Horrible sight lines, small uncomfortable seats... This place is obsolete.  Awful.",0
The food here is soooooooo FUCKN GROSS NOW!!! Don't eat here... The chef SUCKX,0

I had the tuna avocado sandwich and the energy booster super smoothie...very tasty! I will be returning to try some of their veggie juices :),0

"Got kicked out of my own room UNDER MY NAME for racist staff employees. Go there if you want redneck, racist assholes",0
"Wonderful old-style country French. Dinner combined with restaurant.com a real bargin, allowing a better bottle of wine. Very attentive service, even from the elderly owner. Perfect for that special occaison.",0
Place isn't and won't ever have the same taste since they switched owners.,0
First all kind and fast service. Good atmosphere the food was great. They have a bunch of options to choose from.,0

There isn't a bad thing I can say about Vito's.  It's one of my wife's and I favorite establishment.  Everything is done well and the service is top notch.  I would not hesitate to recommend this place.,0

"Landmark is definitely a favorite place of mine the service is good the food is plentiful and the prices are low, it's not a super fancy place but a good old fashioned diner..",0

"Came here for brunch and wasn't impressed with the selection on the menu, ordered the scrambled eggs which were OK.  I will go back to try dinner at some point but I am not in a rush.",0
I have been very pleased coming here. Their beer/wine/liquor selections are wonderful. Food and coffee is also great. Will be back here for sure.,0
Simple sweet little course. Expansive views of the LV Strip.,0
This is one of the better Pho joints among the many scattered on Spring Mountain Road. Super casual and decent service. Note: They take CASH ONLY.,0
"This place needs to be on The Food Network show, \""Restaurant: IMPOSSIBLE\""... I need to remind myself not to eat here in the future unless its free... and even then.",0
Ordered a Spanish latte. Zero foam and not hot enough. Not very good for its price. They were definitely rushing it.\nThe location is convenient though.,0

Great airport. You can gamble while u wait.,0
Food is ok for the price. Menu never changes though. Can get boring.,0
Love this place for produce. Clean and well stocked. Short wait times in line. Probably wouldn't pick up anything else here. But that's OK.,0
"This place is not what it once was. it is a shell of its self, with outsourced beer production, canned food, and bad service. Sorry to be so negative, it has earned it however.",0
i don't see how this place is much better than some other fast food establishments. i'd rather go to in n n out.,0
Amazing fresh food. Great service. Very nice atmosphere. This is exactly what we were looking for. We will put this on our list of favorite places!,0

"My food came out cold, and the server was no where to be found, the drinks were good though.",0
Fun college bar.  This is the place to go see girls dancing on the bar.  Top 40 music.,0
I can't wait for the day I walk away from a $120/person steak dinner feeling like I got what I paid for.  This wasn't it.,0
"I'm spoiled by the outlet mall in Vegas cuz this one sucks. No Sketchers killed it for me, but I didn't see a ton of other shops I wanted to visit when I went looking for shoes. Bummer.",0
"This place is not a bad place for a bowling alley. The food here isn't that terrific, but what can you expect? Had a group party here and it was a fun place to go. Overall not a bad place to hang out.",0
It was ok. Definitely better than subway or quiznos. Nothing I would go out of my way to get.,0
Very expensive for a bowl of soup just over $7.00. Also the very small potato chips for the Kettle bag is $1.99. Really!!! That is way to high for 4oz of chips and mostly air.,0
"Stopped in, had a couple of drinks, paid and left. Nothing to get excited over, but a decent stop if you like Irish whiskey and need a fix.",0
"Always excellent, down home style cooking. Never disappoints. Breakfasts are especially great",0
I called to get an idea on fixing a plumbing issue.  The person on the phone was very rude and short.  Needless to say I'll take my business elsewhere.,0
"The amount of space this airport takes up is huge. Way to big, the walk to your gate is forever. If your making a connection its even worse.",0
This place is good. The pho is great. It's clean and the service is great. Spring rolls are worth a try too and the ice coffee.,0
"I had the Cuban chicken sandwich, which was really good. The bread was done just like a Cuban sandwich down in Miami. The sweet potato fries were OK, the dipping sauce was good.",0
"Average for me, NJ pizza rules, this place was ok, no complaints.",0
"Their patio is a nice area, wait staff was nice as well. However the food was alright, not worth the slightly elevated prices and they charge for extra chips and salsa.",0
I once saw a puppy run from the kitchen into the side area. I asked the waitress about it and she said it was her daughters pet.,0
Bartender is the rudest p.o.s.,0
We always enjoy the service and good food. Also can't beat the ice cold beer with dinner.,0
"Fairly mediocre, even by the relatively modest standards of Home Depot. Unfortunately, this is probably the best you're going to do for hardware in most of Pittsburgh.",0
One of my favorite places for Greek good. Chicken pita sandwich is delicious! I'm in love with the their Greek fries!,0
Lame. Don't believe the fat old bald guy out front that says it's illegal to use anything but their drivers. He's a liar. Use uber. It's cheaper.,0

"Amazing place, great food, better service. Melinda always takes care of me and offers great customer service! Even the fried rice is exceptional here! :)",0
This spot is a must stop for anyone looking for delectable dishes in the Vegas area that are off the strip. They have previously won the best of Vegas award and continue to achieve that same standard.,0
"Servers are chatting, not paying attention to tables. I can see my salad is ready at the window. Worst serves ever.",0
I have such fond memories of Orange Julius from when I was a kid.  And you know what they are still really really good. The only reason I gave them a four? It's kind of expensive!!!,0
Unfortunately overpriced for the quality of the food. I feel like you could have the same items at another restaurant that is less stuffy and old-school than this place.,0
Good food!  I ordered a chicken lavosh and it came with a bonus side salad.  Despite being packed waiter was attentive.  I would go back!,0
The setting is gorgeous.  The beer is good.  And the jambalaya is nice and spicy.,0
A nice little Asian store that has a bunch of Asian stuff for those wanting to have some Asian flavor in their life. I was able to find the green tea that I was craving here.,0
It's a pretty good breakfast place. Kind of like Denny's and their service there is alright. It's more of a good rest stop type of diner than a family friendly diner.,0
"Always one of my favorites, can't go wrong with the chicken Madeira (my favorite dish there). The chili was great too. One of the only places that no matter how full I am it is a must to get dessert.",0
"Good cheap Chinese food. Close to home, so it's a winner with me. Always friendly, pretty consistent quality.",0
Unpretentious Wisconsin-y hangout with good live music.,0
"Great service and the Toasted Blue Cheese Chips are a great appetizer. Lots of salads, pastas and burgers to choose from. We will definitely return.",0
This place is horrible the food is so over Americanized it didn't even have flavor was Super Dissapointed! I live near by and I will never go back!,0
"Not impressed. My 29 dollar pizza was not only cold when it showed up, but flavorless as well. At least my toddlers seem to like it...",0
The large employee guy with blonde hair was belligerent and trying to start fights with several us last night. He needs to be fired and needs to be some changes made.,0
"Favorite starving student food!\nCheap as heaven, tasty as hell.\nI'd recommend the sandwiches and also getting a bakers dozen.\n\nThe onion bagel is the best.",0
A pain to get in and out of. I dread each trip I have to take to this place.,0
"This is about 2 steps up from IHOP. If you're looking for a quick breakfast place to hit outside of the typical weekend brunch hours, it could suffice, but definitely do not stick around if there's a wait.",0
This place is overpriced for what you get....the food is okay.  Not very authentic.,0
most horrible experience i have ever had at a restaurant. The pasta was very under cooked and the pasta sauce had no taste. horrible unprofessional wait staff,0
Just ordered 5 pies for Thanksgiving. TERRIBLE!!! Crusts were so thick and raw. Pecan pie filling was so chewy it had to be thrown away! They have lost a lifelong customer! Mary Hedges,0
"Great store, great ife xream. My wife and i go here and its always worth the cost. Its also geat that they let me call in an order then pick it up for those quick stops on lunch break.",0
Looks western but doesn't feel it!  Cant imagine this as a local bar more a tourist bar.\n\nIt's an okay bar with some good live music.  Staff was nice.,0
A delicious Carne Asada burrito. I can't wait to go back and trust me it will be soon.,0
I don't often go with my boys to the strip clubs nearer downtown and this place is why! Horrible and smelled really bad. There was one nice girl there n wish I could remember her name. The 2 stars are for her!,0
Fried pork chop and steamed chicken with green onions and soy sauce. But the waiters are idiots!,0
This place is good for pizza or pricey salads. The salads are really tasty though. Just don't order the stuffed pizza they are all cheese and very heavy and gross.,0
So easy to work with! Robert and his staff were professional and made our wedding that much more memorable. The food was amazing and the cake was the best I've ever tasted!,0
"So i have been there a half a dozen times, and this time the food was just OK. Times before it was fantastic. They are definitely not the most polite people in the world, but the food is 'usually.'",0
My buddy found glass in his noodle bowl glass.  As hit bit down and starting spitting glass out of his mouth we decided that this was are last visit here.,0
The service here is awesome.\nCool little hardware store.,0
"Nothing stood out, including the famous burnt almond torte.",0
This place is absolutely gross the bathroom is horrible the rooms are dirty the wait time is insane over 4 hours when someone is in extreme pain is insane! Avoid this place if I could give it -100 stars I would,0
I ordered the dumplings and pineapple fried rice.I've never had fried rice that was so white-It lacked flavor. The dumplings were just okay. I don't think I will come back here for Chinese food.,0
"Several steps up from Fort McDowell, several steps down from Talking Stick.",0
Get the asiago cheese bagel with sun-dried tomato cream cheese!!!!!!!!!,0
"It's a nice hotel for what it is. Cheap!\n\nRoom was decent, had a clean shower and refrigerator. \n\nBed was soft. What else could you ask for?!",0

Nice local place! Great late night specials and the bbq ribs are fall off the bone great.  The bartenders are friendly and know how to make a great drink.,0
I'm impressed with the cleanliness. The food was better than average and service was solid.  Pricing was right.   I'll come back.,0
Try the moo shu pork!!  It's great to watch the staff wrap each roll using chop sticks. Such skill. I have none!,0
Fantastic chopped salad.  I had the pork shank; very good.  We went to dinner with another couple and really enjoyed the whole experience.,0
"This is the ABSOLUTE BEST Pizza in Henderson. The crust, sauce and toppings are amazing. I got the Super Six and loved it. I really like Metro Pizza but this is way better.",0

This is a gem in this area.  Great staff Margie is a godsend.  Love this place.,0

5 stars for their red velvet cupcakes. Yummy!,0
"Stopping through Madison...It's a solid establishment. Free popcorn, cheap food, decent service. Nothing spectacular.",0
"I love the atmosphere here, it's very chill. Their coffee isn't bad and the service is pretty good. Also, they are open \""late\"", so that's an added bonus if you need to make a coffee run at 11 at night",0
My daughter came here for swim plugs and she really thought it was fun to get them made.  I came for fitted ear plugs and I also had a good experience.,0
"so much delicious food. so little stomach room. i'll be back Harlow's...oh yes, i will be back.",0

Always a great day when I get to go to this store! I always find cute stuff! Just wish they were closer to me!,0

"Consulted him for setting up an estate plan.  First meeting was free, and he was informative.  We haven't made our decision yet, but he is definitely worth interviewing for the assignment.",0
Stay away from the sicilian unless your want a pound of bread...,0
"Best. Food. Ever. But only open until 4:30pm! And not Sundays either. \n\nRegardless, the Akin's plate has to be one of the premiere bang-for-your-buck meals on State Street.",0
This is our favorite Indian restaurant in the city.  Very consistent and good.  Authentic decorations and music.  Be ready to search for parking during the college school year.,0
Used to be a regular at this bar.  They fired Dawn the bartender who was the best worker this bar had.  Will return when she is rehired.,0
"The place has an awful smell, the condiments table is super dirty, and my Chicago beef was lackluster",0
Average pizza and the interior was a bit on the dirty side for my liking,0
This place smells like a urinal and bums and druggies hanging out in front. Will never go here and I advise you don't either.,0

"I gotta say they've upgraded their menu. The waitress was greatr. The prices are good. Will go back, now.",0

"This place used to be great, with unique dishes, yummy breadsticks with special butters and complimentary white chocolate for dessert. Now it's just average, with nice outdoor seating.",0
Mediocre place. Service is trying to sell over priced items. House wine is less than expectations. Overall experience is disappointed.,0
"Great place for a business lunch or lunch with friends.  Had a fabulous sandwich, grilled ham and brie, and roasted green bean salad.  Nice, clean, friendly atmosphere!",0
This is the kind of bar that everyone turns around to see who entered. Not comfortable atmosphere unless your from this side of town. Two small tv sets at bar and not much else.  Skiperooni.,0
"Good place for drinking or seeing a band play.\n\nFood is decent, taps are great, staff is pleasant.\n\nAwful karaoke though. AAA entertainment I think it was, no bueno.",0
"This is by far, my favorite mexican food place. The chips are sooo good. and everything else is good. The workers are really nice too. \n\nand they have sangria! :)",0
Two stars is being generous.  But at least I now have a place to go to if I want rude service and milky coffee drinks.,0
Posted hours: 10:45am. Doors are locked at 11:15 and no one picks up the phone. Hopefully this means they are out of business because this place has gone so far down hill,0
Cute little coffee shop. Had some tea and sat outside with my boyfriend. Enjoyed the weather and played some cards. Very relaxing.,0
love this place. great food with local feel.,0
Absolutely love this place! Jill and Eric are amazing! Service can't be beat!! The Little cheesy omelet is perfect size.,0

Great dive bar and great bartenders. Jester room is a must.,0
"I love this Gym, its where I got my passion for health. Its quiet and only old people work out there. The membership is cheap and the trainers are very knowledged",0
Family run small business in Tempe. Everything was tasty but not terribly exciting. Very limited options. Seems authentic.,0
This place never seems to disappoint me. I'm always extremely satisfied on every visit. The food is great so as the service. It's a great family restaurant and caters crowd of every kind,0
"I have only had lunch there, never breakfast. The sandwiches are average and the prices are steep. The waitstaff is usually always very pleasant!",0
I came here to get my car washed and I had no idea what I was doing. Everyone I spoke to was so helpful and patient! My car is my baby and they took good care of her. :),0
"Nate, the bartender, is hilarious and some great entertainment. The food is delicious to boot!",0
This place SUCKS!  The food was horrible and the service was ridocuoulsly slow.  STAY AWAY,0
Better than average BDubs here.  Service is good and beer is nice and cold.,0
Excellent dinner. Had a New York Strip steak and Scallops for $22.00,0
I refuse to be treated like a criminal by default. I WILL NOT give up my personal property becaue they think I might steal something. \n\nMost of the stuff in this place is junk.,0
"Food great, service great, but the restaurant was filthy. Workers standing around talking while every table was dirty, floor and soda counter disgusting. I was there 45 minutes and no one made a move to clean anything.",0
Downstairs bar is an absolute favorite.  Great small plates and even better service.  I love their stemware. :),0
"This is a great little store, with a very nice wine section. It is the best gourmet store I've ever seen. They really do it right!",0
"Once again, you cant beat Papa Johns pizza, especially when they are on sale. Quick online ordering & quick (usually) delivery. Pizza always arrives hot, as I ordered it, and tasty.",0
Will never come to this place again. Don't even bother doing punch cards because the old lady will find an excuse to say is not valid.,0
The Phoenix airport is a good example of a large small airport.  It has pretty good flights and seems to be fairly updated.  Food options are good too.,0
"The food here is awesome. I always get the half chicken. If you get corn tortillas it's a healthy delicious lunch. Remember, it's cash only.",0
Nothing fancy about this place. Just good old-fashioned thin crust pizza. Take-out only. And you can buy a bag of fresh pizza dough for a dollar.,0
"Simply put, This is the best Chinese-fare in the city.Served fast and hot by attentive Wait Staff.",0
"Fast service at the drive through, very good coffee. Support local businesses instead of chains and drop in at Cargo Coffee! I always go through this place in the morning when I am in Madison on business.",0
"All station casinos are great in general but I like the Boulder because it's never super congested, the cafe has some of the best pastries, they have all kinds of bonuses and perks for gamblers and the staff are so friendly.",0
"I have been going to this place for years. From 16th street to Tatum to 27th avenue. One thing that they all all do the same is the \""Parisian\"" omelette. Tasty and fast.",0
"This was a nice experience - the ambience nice, with the brick walls. The food very homemade tasting.",0
Music way too loud. Cannot have conversation without almost yelling,0
The Laurel Market is another quaint Charlotte institution that is full of character (and sometimes characters!).  I like the wine section and can always find something new to try.,0
"The hotdogs are okay, pricing isn't bad, but the guy that was serving me was a douche! I've been to places where the food was good enough to overlook the service... this isn't one of them!",0
They lost my clothes and charged me for stuff I never sent.\n\nClearly they do not know what they are doing and need to get their act together!!,0
"I'm a regular at this establishment, and always been treated with respect and kindness, great costumer service.",0
Garbage is the only nice word that comes to mind,0
Good flavor selection. They offer that you try flavor. Ample parking.,0
"Just don't bother ordering anything if you're seated. Staff won't bother, either.",0
Food was crap. Everything tasted the same. Like they have one universal sauce. Service was decent. Won ton soup suckd. Broth with one won ton. No vegetables. Wont eat here again,0
Love the free wi-fi and the fly by lanes in terminal 4.\nI'll probably bump up my review once all the new food choices get in!,0
"Eeh. Its okay if you feel like taking a day off from the kitchen. Had their dessert once, I wasn't blown away but im not really big on sweets. Service isnt the greatest either.",0
"Been closed awhile, the website lives on FOREVER",0
Many great revolving beers on tap and a delish black-bean burger. Play pool inside or sit outside -- I love this joint.,0
"Got info on the tortillas, they are full of lard and trans fat. So for anyone concerned with living with a healthy heart, please be warned.\n\nStill love the salsa! :)",0
Worst service. Two hours for a tire change them when nearly commpleat they take brake for 30 min.\n I'm the only customer waiting. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE\nLunch is more important,0
"This place has legit beer and good food.  The atmosphere is a little noisy, but it's a fun place that I'll definitely re-visit!",0
"My favorite place to take the kids to lunch. Also great for quick \""to-go\"" work lunches. Sign up for Panera Rewards. I always end up getting a surprise treat from the rewards I have collected.",0
"Just wanted a trim, got a quick perfunctory cut.  Grumpy hairdresser.",0
"I've been eating here for years, through the second owner. Authentic Mexican food at a very reasonable price.  Would have rated it higher but on my last visit the sanitation grade has dropped to 91.",0
"Good pretzels, though I am convinced the pretzel \""game\"" is a racket.",0
"Dined in twice, food ok, atmosphere good.",0
Great place to break up the hustle and bustle of Vegas. Clean theaters and friendly staff.,0
OVERHYPED.  I've had better burgers almost everywhere.,0
Best Gyro's in town! Awesome customer service! The Gyros are huge and so filling. We'll be back!,0
What's with long lines to get breakfast! Very disappointing.,0
R.I.P. Pats Pizza. So sad we have lost our neighborhood eatery to self demise. After eating from Pats for years with an occasional disappointment my last 3 delivery orders have been inedible. Good Bye and RIP.,0
"I was there to see Dixie Swim Club, The play was fun the actors were very good.  The food was horrible!!",0
"THE best cheesesteaks, freshest buns, there is nothing bad here!!",0
"Simply put, I'd go back.  They are quick and have always called back to tell me what issues are going on with my rig.",0
Terrible service sitting at the bar for happy hour. My glass sat empty for long periods of time.   A passing waiter actually saw the empty glass and gave it to the bar tender. Sad.,0
From living in NYC for 27 years I tried this place and I took one bite and threw it all away. And very expensive,0
"Me and the wife stayed a night, the room was nice and appeared to be clean, \nhowever my wife woke up with Three BED BUG BITES on her leg!",0
They no longer have a liquor license. As of 3/7/12! :(,0
Always full when I walk in but they are working fast to service people.,0
Best sushi in town for the price. Happy hour is a bargain. Patio is nice especially during this time of year (spring)...highly recommend this place!,0
Delivery boy never showed up. Manager does not seem to care.  Not recommended,0
"Kids area filthy, fries incredibly salty, tables dirty. Love this food chain, but go to another franchise location. Go to StoneCrest or another to get a much better experience.",0
"I've eaten here a couple times, once for breakfast and once for dinner.  The food is good but overpriced for the amount you get.  The employees were nice and the service was fast.",0

I got an oil change and AC recharge for my car.  They squeezed me in with no appointment and everything was done quickly.  I am happy with my results.,0
"Really good food at the given price. If you're looking for cheap, good Mexican, this is the place to go to. Will definitely go back.",0
"Their sandwiches just miss.\n\nThe pastrami, steak and turkey are plentiful, but flavorless.\n\nI have had better at other Capriotti's and certainly at other sandwich shops.",0
I go to this gym 4-5 times a week. place is always clean and the owner is hands on. If a machine is broken or cable needs to be fixed it is always taken care of quickly.,0
"Another east-side dive bar... not great, but not bad either.",0
Specifically the Southwest terminal is pretty terrible when it comes to food choices on a layover. There are some pretty cool views of the strip as you fly in but in terms of airport amenities..... Just pass right on through,0
"Some seriously tasty pizza.  Felt like I was back in Italy again.  Love that they have pizza marinara listed right on the menu, which is an excellent option for vegan folks!",0
"the burgers were the same as any fast food place. it had a nice atmosphere, but the food left much to be desired.",0
"1st time here... won't be our last, really good! The fried chicken is way better than any other place I've had on this side of town. Staff was very friendly.",0
"When it is blazing hot in Phoenix, get a ice cold beverage which they have lots of.  One block away from the office I work in when I go to Phoenix so it is pretty sweet.",0
"Enjoyed the lunch but service is slow. Glad to see an updated menu, wish dinner was offered.",0
Best brewery I've been to in the United States! I like the fact that there was a wide variety of beer. Something for everybody. But it was also some of the best beer,0
"I love these cakes - great flavor, moist, sweet frosting, over all delicious.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  However I only gave 4 stars because the store is closed on Sunday, the day I usually crave their cake!",0
Went there with three kids. The service was excellent. The ice cream was great and the kids had fun choosing from the many delicious flavors and treats.,0
"We went to see the zoo lights while visiting Phoenix.  I am certain the lights took a very long time to put up and people worked hard to put on the show but I,  personally,  wasn't impressed.",0
"Good coffee, good shakes, good pastries, good people, great atmosphere. I heart Smelly Cat!",0
This place is authentic Japanese izakaya cuisine (tapas). It alwsys delivers. Sushi is excellent. Tempura light and crisp. And the little plates are all awesome. Favorite is salmon skin salad.,0
"Not the best Hilton has to offer, location is good but more than a resort this place looks like a remodeled WWII bomb bunker. Other than that service is the best, most important the beds are top notch and the food is good.",0
Sorry to break to you but  it seems another Village  inn has bitten the dust...,0
The food was good. But our waitress was so rushed and stomping around.  We are finishing up and my stomach is in knots from nerves watching this waitress rush around.  Sloppy service almost spilling anything with liquid in it.,0
Okay food and good service.  The meatloaf was dry and the veggies had no flavor.,0
Customer service in the pharmacy is terrible there's no follow through on prescriptions or orders or call the doctors I always have some issue with picking up my prescriptions and today I went there to go through the drive thru and it's closed,0
"goldiggers everywhere, place smells like smoke, no class\n\njust no",0
Went there just to get coffee in the morning and the one thing I need in the morning COFFEE was apparently out of order.,0
Awesome sushi. Nigiri sushi here is a must-try.,0
Lovely place to sit and have quiet time. They have a great area for children and helpful staff. They also have a Starbucks with some lunch options. They will serve you on glass plates and warm up your pastries,0
closed?  Sign on the door says the landlord seized everything.,0
"I love this Home Depot! Everyone is very friendly! \""Art\"" pointed us in the direction of a $5 solution for what was looking like a $1,000 problem. Very helpful, well-stocked and close to my home.",0
Food is always made fresh and I have never had to wait too long.  Good place to come for lunch if you work in the area.,0
Horrible. Ordered a pizza bagel (which they charge over $5 for) had about 1/2 teaspoon of sauce and a few shreds of cheese (see photo). Laughable. I won't be back here.,0
"The hop knot is off the hook. Tried a sampler of all the beers, hop knot and porter was the best. Good micro brew one of the best I have been to in a long while.",0
"They misdiagnosed our cat as having diabetes. After the cat went into insulin shock they said 'well, sometimes it just goes away.' Seems like they to want to kill animals as expensively as possible.",0
Had guests from out of state so we visited Four Peaks for lunch on Saturday. None of us were disappointed. I could become a regular here!,0
We went here on Father's Day and had a very enjoyable meal.  Overall the food was good and arrived quickly.  The service was great.  We'll be going back.,0

"This is THE movie theatre that should get your business. Always clean, great customer service!! AMC is a joke!!!",0
"We had a wonderful dinner on the patio tonight. The weather was as perfect as the food, the service was great and we will definitely be back.",0
"Watch out for the crack windshield guys, after you make a claim to your insurance your rates will go up for filing a claim.",0
"Don't order from this place! SCAM they gave me the wrong pizza. I called to ask if I could get the right one, they said no and hung up. Really???",0
Best sports bar in town bar none.  Great food.  Golden Tee.  Dozens of TVs.  No reason to watch a game anywhere else.,0
I've been here once and had a pretty good time in the Shaker Room. But it was disgusting and hot in there. \n\nSO not worth paying any sort of cover... ever,0
"Go for breakfast, they have very good pancakes and omlet. Never very go their for lunch.",0
can spend a long time here looking around some days you find something good other days well not so much,0
Used it for take-out on a recent trip to Scottsdale. I would say it is stereotypical red sauce and pasta food - nothing special.  The eggplant was overcooked and dry.,0
Giddy up. Food was actually ok. Service not so much.,0
"Tried to go, they were closed an hour early with employees outside drinking. Not impressed.",0
Had the worst burgers from Mickey D's from this location.  Filed a complaint and NEVER received a call back!!!  Horrible dry and old burgers (and they were premium $$$ burgers)...$17 for 2 meals!,0
This place is good depending on what you get. Kind of hit and miss. I had a Carne aside burrito I didn't like. The lunch special is a good deal. The beans are really good. Fried fish is really good.,0
Came to have some buffet this afternoon and it's empty with a sign posted that This place is now closed permanently  :(,0
The only place I feel it's acceptable to have a drink...or more at an airport.,0
"I really love this place, the inside makes you feel right at home. The food is always excellent. They're artichoke dip is sooo good! And they're bread baskets are awesome!",0
"Double check your Togo order because they did not put anything I have requested in my Togo order. Not enough of sauce, wrong butter, and gave me the wrong shrimp.",0
Pizza is good. But its over priced. We go here when our regular pizza place is closed.,0
"The brew is ok I have had better, and the pizza is ok, nothing crazy good and the atmosphere is alright, I'd rather go somewhere else any day.",0
Great Restaurant with great food nice wine. The inside ambience is good but there's no nice view of the city.,0
Manager there has no people skills very rude and unprofessional. Will never shop there again.,0
Pretty good bar food.  It's conveniently located and a fun atmosphere.,0
Theaters are clean and we'll kept.  Staff are friendly.  Popcorn is marginal at best stale!,0
"Last time I went here I got food poisoned, so tread carefully.",0
"Quick, decent nothing amazing. the fried rice was good and egg drop soup decent. if you're looking just to crave a Chinese craving it works.",0
Food was great. Host staff was great. Server was too anxious to go home. Texting and side work was more important than serving our table. Overall was good though.,0
I like it more for hanging out and having a pint.,0
This museum appealed to both the casual anthropologist and the photographer in me. Very educational both inside and out. It is a relay race of science and mystery.,0
This was the most disturbingly bland meal. Yuck.,0
"I'm gonna keep this review short and simple. The food is real good and the atmosphere is hilarious. If its busy, you might have to wait a little before you get your food, but its well worth the wait.",0
"Chicken fried steak more like chicken fried doodoo, nastiest chicken fried steak I ever had in my life. I'll stick to the breakfast menu.",0
"The people who work there are great and they make the best coffee there, that's why I keep going back",0
golden medium wings!!!!!!!! Also really good beer specials and they have some really good looking waitresses,0
They always have friendly staff. The store is neatly organized and everything is easy to find. Always have a quick checkout.,0
"Very friendly service at the drive thru!! 48 degrees out side, I'm ordering a large chili!",0
"Best service in town, maybe in the world.  This newly blossoming empire around town also serves up the ultimate hangover cure, especially when complimented by a Propel.  Store that fact away, it's a useful one.",0
"Very cheap, room was clean. Free parking with rewards card. Staff was friendly. The only negative thing is the noise level. Can't sleep at night with the bands playing.",0
"Good experience.  The dr was very detailed.  I wasn't 100% comfortable with the sonographer, but she managed to get the pictures the dr. needed...eventually.",0
Yea a pretty good sports bar.  Nice staff and good wings (been there only once).  There's a front bar and a rear bar for overflow.,0
"Smelled like pee, had tweekers standing outside looking like they couldn't wait to break into your car the minute you walked inside & no one noticed us or seated us so we left. Won't go back there ever again.",0
Luggage took FOREVER to get.  Must have been standing there for at least 30 minutes.  Doh!,0
Thad did a really good job on my heart tattoo.  The place is kind of old and dingy but the work area environment was sterile.\nI would defiantly let Thad do another tattoo for me.,0
Watery coffee. Tea water lukewarm. Food unexceptional. Noisy. Why all the stars again?,0
It's nice to see all the old signs. Learned more than I wanted to know about sign making. The tour guide was very informative.,0
One of my favorite breakfast places in Madison.  The salmon hash is a dream.  And Tim bakes the best biscuits in town!,0
The place is nice and Big! lots of seating space with a few comfy seats such as lazyboy style seats. In a really cute house looking thing. The service is ok. A little more friendly would really make this place pop.,0
"Food was OK prices were outrageous combination plates are an average 10 dollars, if you want cheese tack on more money. Been there done that won't return......",0
Fabulous crab cakes and oysters.  Thus place feels like dining in a tree house with rock'n music. The patio is fun and casual.,0
I was in town for a business trip and found this nail salon by using my yelp app. Glad I did because I had a terrific pedi and shellac manicure!,0
Always fantastic food. well priced and quick service. Tasty!,0
The standard breakfast is fine.  The unusual items are just unusual.,0
it's a healthy breakfast all day looking joint.  Remind me of sunrise cafe in Vegas.   very friendly service and prompt.  Definitely a good spot to go.,0
This is more of a fast food restaurant for me.  I think it's decent for something quick that will stay with you for awhile.,0
"Large portions, enough food for multiple meals. Ordered the Hawaiian Plate with kalua pork. Yum. Awesome prices! Friendly service. \n\nWould definitely visit again if in town.",0
"Aweful service. You don't feel welcome at this place. I live close by and thought i d have a place to go if i don't want to drive but they won't see me or my friends, never again!",0
I confirmed with restaurant.com that the voucher was valid and that the owner acted in an inappropriate manner.  AVOID PITA HOUSE.,0
Indeed one of the best Mediterranean restaurants in town! The Greek salad dressing is authentic and delish. Can't wait to go back.,0
Check your bread out.  It's not very good anymore.  Too cheap or bad baker.,0
"Overpriced. I ordered steak. Nothing to write home about. Better, cheaper choices abound.",0
Don't get your keys made here - they never work.  3 different times this has happened. Not a fluke.,0
Usual Asian super market no one speaks English or anything. But if you need Asian stuff good place and its clean.,0
"Great location in Verona!  The bar is beautiful and they pour a large glass of wine for a good price.  Food is marginal at best, but not consistent.  The only thing I enjoy eating is the cheese bread.",0
Good food. Kind service- quick service. Juice smoothies are refreshing addition to typical middle eastern menu. Casual dress.,0
Great for kids haircuts. Terrible for adults. Never going again,0
I literally ate two ribs and decided they were too much like a pressed mcrib to trust them. The cornbread tasted faintly of fish. Fries were decent. Couldn't get a refill on my soda. I won't be back.,0
"My filet was overcooked and it's annoying when a restaurant serves your appetizers when they haven't asked to take your order and expect you to eat with menus in your way. Vodka martinis were tasty.\""",0
Awesome food service and atmosphere. We throughly enjoyed our dinning experience and strongly recommend this restaurant to all our friends and family,0
Gotta agree fully with Mike on this one. They're pushing Obama so hard that we may as well give the presidential election to McCain. \n\nMaybe it's time to move to Canada...,0
Outstanding donuts.  The regular donuts are much better than Dunkin or Krispy Kreme.  The cake donuts are about the same.  Definitely our new go-to donut place!,0
"Feels like a step back in Wisconsin time, the interior design and furniture is all cut, carved from local materials. Food is average, service is average.",0
I come here all the time today there was a new lady she was not nice at all. Go to the one on Jones and Desert Inn better customer service.,0
I got the worst food poisoning I have ever had in my life from this place. It has been three days and I'm still having trouble eating and digesting food. I do not recommend eating here,0
The chicken was nasty and fatty and still had the skin on it and not much sauce. It was a good deal of you like plain rice. Will never go back.,0
"Out of business, not surprising they have been going down hill for years.",0
"Went to dinner tonight and got horrible service, nothing worse than serving you a semi-warm overpriced beer in a warm glass. Food was ok way overpriced.",0
If your in the hotel or casino and looking for a decent meal than this will do. Food is okay just typical buffet food at a decent price.,0
"What a disappointment.  Terrible service, no bread until requested three times, bland unseasoned food and 16 bucks for a salad. Pass on this place. Only the valet was worthwhile.",0
Average lamps store.  It is a good place for purchasing lamps.  Slightly expensive at times.,0
"Yo, their store is awesome!  That dude, Richard, is da bomb! He hooked it up hardcore, mos def!",0
Fast service. Weston was an awesome waiter. Loved the Chips and Salsa. It had a really pretty ceiling.,0
I just tried the Jersey Mike's in Salisbury and it makes these guys look like pikers. They should take a drive up there and see how they really should be doing things.,0
"Compared to other Whole Foods locations, this one is tiny! For comparison, the Whole Foods in Las Vegas must be at least three times the size. Still, it's nice to have and it is pretty decent overall albeit pricey.",0
Told me 30 minutes... It took over an hour and 15 mins - Please provide realistic expectations. Your only setting yourself up for failure. Poor service :(,0
"Awful chinese food.  There are so many better places around south Charlotte than this sad excuse of a restaurant.  The food is tasteless, service is crappy, restaurant is dirty.  Please do yourself a favor and skip.",0
I thought that the kitchen was very clean. The food was good and fresh!!,0
"Front desk was helpful and polite, with bright smiles. Rooms were fun because of the historical aspect, as well as the pictures and newspaper articles posted around the hotel. Clean, too :)",0
Las vegas roll is all you need to know,0
Service an atmosphere was great. I had the shrimp boil and it was very under-seasoned. Much closer to bland than anything.,0
"Friendly service, great food, neat atmosphere.  I like the heat and they don't disappoint.  This one will be a regular stop.",0
"Don't drink the water... or eat the food. I got serious, serious food poisoning from this place.",0
Love the take out here.  Very easy to order online and to pick it up. Not a hassle at all.,0
"Signed up on the internet yesterday. Today, eating a full free breakfast and its good. Smartphone coupons,google it.",0
"This store has such bad service. The service staff are rude rude rude.  Save your money, shop elsewhere.",0
Great course.  Well maintained.  The staff is great from the moment you drive up. When in Las Vegas a must play for the price.,0
Beautiful atmosphere but way too pricey! They're skimpy on providing rice and tend to hold back on flavoring their entrees. Spiciness doesn't make bland food into good food.,0
"The burgers are fresh and hearty, but the lettuce provided kept falling out of my burger. But overall the guacamole bacon cheeseburger was fantastic! The fries could've used a little less salt.",0
"will not return because management will not accept certain coupons! and he was very rude! you'll know who he is, hes very big.",0
"Very slow service, over 55 minutes to check out. Lady did not know what she's doing.",0
Wanted a Pedicure and figured I'd give this place a try since it was across the street from my hotel.,0
"I've never seen anything more ghetto in my life. Walmart is already disgusting, well times that by 3.6 million and you have the Nellis location. iky",0
"Good food, usually very fast, and a convenient location. I definitely recommend if you are looking for fast food",0
As far as pizza goes... Um no thanks.,0
Food and service were mediocre at best. Cost was about the same as anywhere else. Would rather go to Breakfast Club.,0
"Note that the shop is not in the strip mall but in a building in the parking lot of the strip mall.  Also, closed on the weeknight I was there.",0
Just in case you didn't lose enough money in las vegas...gamble more at this airport while you wait for your flight! LoL...,0
Good breakfast spot with friendly service.  Definitely has a diner vibe.,0
"Descent boneless wings, cold beer, good variety on the menu.  Our waitress was attentive.",0
"Came for pie and coffee with my lady! The pie was excellent, the coffee was hot, and the server, Isaiah was superb!",0
Food was good but soup wasn't hot.  Service was incredibly slow even though no one was in the restaurant but a couple other two tops.  I'd come back but try a different server next time.,0
Gorgeous- immaculate historic estate- very spacious stay in the Mt Vernon room. Wonderful breakfast- great friendly staff!,0
Tried to stop for a quick car lunch on the way to court. 10 minutes later I'm trapped in line and still hungry. Slowest fast food in America.,0
Great pizza! The wait can be long so hit it up when college is out.,0
"Mom loved the place! It was another great experience visually and food was delicious as usual! Must come and dine, its a western experience you don't want to miss.",0
I stayed @ 4 queens when i went last month and this is the place to go.,0
Everything about this hotel was top notch! The service truly was outstanding and there to please any way possible. Thank you for [providing everyone of our requests and making our stay very memorable,0
The worse place ever. 90% of the machines are not working. I get the fact that most people in this city have their own machines and the only reason why I came here was to wash my comforters. But never again.,0
The Room was way too small for my big ass...the casino was nice though.,0
Horrible customer service and when I talked to the manager she apologized but you can tell she didn't care.,0
Good for half sandwich and soup deals here. I love the pastrami sandwich here. French onion soup is delicious and they have a full salad bar too.,0
If your looking for Philly sandwiches in Vegas. This is a good stop. As close as your going to get. They also have Wise potato chips and TastyKake.,0
"Terrible service. Food was mediocre, deserts were inedible.",0
Good prices but this location is a disaster.  No organization whatsoever.  Will stick to the red white and blue thrift store.  I shouldn't have to search 6 aisles for a black pirate t-shirt.,0
"I think I might open a store, right next door to you.",0
Its not bad. If you feel the need to gamble. Waitress' are fast if your tipping.But all in all not bad. The bartenders are a little slow.,0
Wait and see! Just turn my car in to them!,0
Love the food.  Very nicely prepared.  Love the atmosphere.  Very dependable.,0
The food was spectacular.  The atmosphere outstanding. The service was lousy.  My waiter was almost nonexistent. Had to wait 15 minutes to get the check on a Saturday afternoon.,0
I love Harris Teeter but this store is one I really don't care for. Service is awful. Manager is terrible. Store is older and needs to be remodeled.,0
Service was slow people here seemed very confused on what was going on they have boxes laying around the store it's 3 stars at best,0
"Greenbush Bar is Madison's best kept secret. The service is knowledgable and friendly, the ambiance is hip and intimate, and the food is some of the very best in Madison.",0
"I've been eating here twice a week for years, because it's one of the few places around where you can still get liver & onions.  And I really like the atmosphere and music.",0
"First time here... Food was really good.. Daughter had a noodle bowl. I had a wrap, we split the wings. We will be coming back.. The only bad thing,no salt in the place.. It could use a little",0
What isn't to love about Thomas Street? They have the best patio ever out back. The food is really good actually. But I love going there for the awesome drink specials and corn hole.,0
the selection was good and everything but i only got 2 slices of roast beef in my sandwich. and my friend only got 2 slices of turkey. they don't give you any meat at all.,0
This location is closed.\nThis location is permanently close as in out of business.,0
"Excellent food. The lamb loin with saffron rice, dates and lentils were delicious. We also had hummus and eggplant appetizers. You will enjoy this restaurant.  Service was very good.",0
"Ick, Sorry, I did give you 2 stars for politeness.  Food was awful!!",0
"we got food poisoning here - egg drop soup.  in addition to being contaminated, the food was poorly prepared and tasted terrible.  i am amazed that some people reviewed this place favorably.",0
This store really needs to work on customer service.  I have been there a few times and the employees are just rude.,0
The service was absolutely fantastic and each dish was very unique although we didn't enjoy our drinks very much.  Very intimate atmosphere.  Great place for a date.,0
"the atmosphere, homemade vegetables, and drink specials sealed the deal for me.\n\nthe cornbread not so much, could use some more salt and flavor.",0
To be honest I expected better. The burger was sloppy and the food was over-priced. I paid $22 for one combo and one with just a burger and drink. Not cool fatburger!,0
Old school steak house feel but a good spot to hit if you son't want to head downtown for some real grubbing!,0
This place smells like cat piss.  Like 100 cats use it as their litter box.  I don't even understand how a place can smell so much like cat piss.,0
"Good food, good service. More of a bar than restaurant.",0
"I like this place. It's a fun atmosphere, the bartender is really friendly and fun. The shots 'banana cum suckers' are soooo good.",0
"They handle the massive traffic quite well.  Free wifi, good selection of food, plenty of places to sit.\n\nStay away from their tight slot machines and be prepared to walk a bit to get to your gates.",0
Great atmosphere to hang out the back patio.   Inside is what you would expect to find in any other bar.,0

"Brilliant little bar. Really friendly staff, and the food was fantastic. The wings are incredible. A must visit! I'll  be back for sure!",0
"OK\n\nSalt and Pepper shrimp (a special) great, fried rice poor.\n\nGreat service, ok quality.\n\nProbably would not go back.",0
Had a friend who went here. REALLY BAD experience,0
"Quick Work, local business, Mike the owner was honest and to the point and replaced our blower motor for AC lickety split for this upcoming HOT weekend-got us our vehicle back the same afternoon.",0
Wonderful Italian food. Especially love their salads and breads. Never been disappointed with any dish they've served. Nice atmosphere and wonderful staff. One of our favorite restaurants.,0
I found a DEAD fly in my salad coated in dressing. The server didn't charge me at least but oh my goodness. I will Not be returning,0
Went there with a friend. Had egg Benedict and did not like it. The turkey meat smells funny. And the waitress kept rushing us. Not sure why it's so crowded. Will not visit again.,0
Sam woo in Los Angeles is better. I came in here last week and a roach crawled on my head as soon as we got seated no joke guys FYI,0
Great place to read or just have a break from the day. Large bay doors are great for letting in sun and fresh air. Typical price range of Starbucks or Caribou with a similar layout as well.,0
This salon is very clean. I like how organized all the products for sale are. I made an appointment for a bang trim and Jason did my hair it looks terrific.,0
So many people have said the positive things that come to my mind about this place too.  This is for sure to become one of my regular spots.,0
"Great food even better ambiance. If the menu was more diverse, especially the dessert portion, this review would be even better. Will be coming back to Bandera again for sure.",0

"Went there with my boyfriend, and it was okay... the food wasn't all that great  but the service was.  the employees there were really nice.",0
"It was a pass through. When I stopped by, it was pretty crowded and there was a dearth of outlets",0
"What a bunch of losers, my kind of people.",0
"A little pricey but it doesn't get more \""natural\"" than this. Great juice bar and cool stuff to buy if you're into super hardcore natural foods.",0
"The lunch crowd was packed... The wait for seating for 2 was 15 minutes, but the service was good.",0
Nice little breakfast place. My only gripes have to do with the laws of Arizona regarding dogs.,0
Love the stores selection but HATE how the girls chase you around to tell you their sales. If I wanted to know I'd ask!!!,0
I honestly was looking forward to trying Pedros and was extremely disappointed. Horribly slow service and cold food was about all I took away from this place.,0
Nice local bar near the Sheraton. Beats the hotel bar any day.,0
Ox tail soup special after 11pm. market Street Cafe.,0
"I love this place, the bartender Stephanie is awesome! never had a bad meal or service here. also great happy hour specials.",0

"our wedding at mon bel ami was personal, professional, the photography was outstanding. I felt like a princess from beginning to end!!'",0
"Had the mushroom swiss burger...always a goodie!! Totally greasy though, it ran down my arm, but was so good! Do I ever eat healthy?! haha",0
So slow will never stop here again. Plenty of places to choose from go there if in a hurry.,0
Cheap and delicious!  Can't beat that.,0
"They made us wait 15min for a table, but there are at least 8 tables empty and set for seating right next to the waiting area. Bad servoce",0
"Better than KFC and even Bojangles!  Friendly staff, fast service, cheap greasy goodness all around.  Bring cash.",0
Rick Orr florist is closed. He apparently retired last year. The phone is being answered by another florist.,0
We walked in and the manager looked at us three times and walked away. This place is awful. Go elsewhere.,0
"Now that is some sad Chinese food. Cheap yes, but not good. I was hoping to find that \"" hole in the wall\"" place that nobody would try without knowing. But it is a rundown crappy place with not so good food.",0
Nice outlet mall. Lots of store to go shop. Nice and quiet. Not to mamy ppl. Security everywhere. Lots of food to chose from.,0
I need to deduct another star for their use of styrofoam cups.  Green definitely it's not.,0
got copies of keys made here and they keys did not even work properly in my door. felt like i was pick locking my own front door. shit like this is a no-no in my book. damn you Ace.,0
"Delicious and great service. We normally sit at the bar but i love the quiet atmosphere and the happy, helpful servers.",0
It's okay. But better gyros are down the street at Z's Greek.,0
Stop here! Buy a block of the dill Havarti and try a bunch of samples. I am sure there will be others that you love :),0
"Good prices, great hookahs, good food! A very chill place to hang out with friends. Also free wifi",0
For a concert arena it was really big and I liked it. Afterwards it got very crowded and I felt a bit uncomfortable. Overall- nice place.,0
"Horrible Service. Food was sub par. Not as good as an Olive Garden. Expected a more authentic taste. The decor was the only positive. Again, horrible SERVICE! I do not recommend.",0
"Check the expiration dates! This location is notorious for having expired stock. It's poorly staffed & the few times I've brought expired items up front, I've been confronted with staff that were not the least bit interested. I avoid shopping here.",0
Worst place to stop and eat in the morning. 3 cars in the drive way and it's taking 20 mins. This is not the first time. Seems only one person works at this time.,0
"I finally found my dive bar.  Right when I walked into the Coach House I could smell the diviness. An old pinball game, cheesy darts, cheap drinks, and rockin music.\n\nI am in love.",0
"Course is in terrible conditions. Muddy, high grass, lots of holes and uneven greens. The poor conditions keep serious players away.",0
"If you need anything, and boy do I mean anything alcohol based... This is the place to find it.",0
They have some really cool beers...more than your typical selections. That's worth 5 stars alone. Food has been great and the patio has a chill vibe. Very awesome place,0
"Very good bagels with a hint of back east charm (small and a bit worn down).  Love the Sunflower bagels, not sure what makes it so tasty but Yum!!",0
"When I want to gorge myself on salad, breads, and pizza, this is where I go. Delicious.",0
The staff here is SUPER friendly and very helpful. I couldn't ask for a better experience in a situation I didn't really want to be in (spending money on tires).,0
"Very bland food, no flavor.  Unimpressed. Quiet atmosphere. Will not be return.",0
I simply cannot review this place because it's too amazing.,0
Very diverse Asian menu!  If you have a hang over go for the Fo!,0
We waited over an hour for a table. The hostesses were beyond rude. The food was ok but definitely not worth the wait. Don't waste your time!,0
Very Good Food in Generous Portions a bit expensive served by a gracious waitstaff--undermanned when we were there.,0
I just love going to the airport and sitting at the bar to people watch. It is a great place to meet new people. although I got bumped off of my flight it was a good time.,0
"Passed by and it is CLOSED! Signage is off, fence surrounding it. Done.",0
"Really fresh, unique beers. Loved the pumpkin stout.\nGood food, had the pierogies, very buttery. \nExcellent friendly service",0
"Had a fabulous eyebrow shaping & waxing after a 6-month grow out forcing sitting on my obsessive hands.  Man, I was so happy to walk out of there with perfect & tame brows!",0
"This airport, unlike any other, is all about getting zero sleep before you zombie walk in to the place, to your gate, and on to your plane. Being fully rested makes the security buzzer go off and is highly not recommended.",0
They have really tasty wings and i LOVE their pizza! Delivery is always fast and they have coupons regularly in the paper. We really go here for the Hot Wings but they are so addicting and delicious that we can't help it!,0
Thieves. They want $6 per check even though the check is from a Bank of America account. Can't stand Bank of America. The dick everyone around.,0
Great Food nice service great steak kind of hidden but well worth the drive +byou can buy restaurant.com to make it cheaper,0
"Delicious sandwiches, cute boys, and kool-aid. I likey.",0
"This is a wonderful family-owned Italian restaurant, probably the best Italian food I've ever had. Definitely the best in Dane County! Get the pasta almatriciana, it's to die for.",0
Fly any other airline.  This one is pathetic.  Crowded smelly terminal and old planes.  Yikes what a disaster.,0
The food there was okay. I had a salmon dish there. I don't eat beef so I can speak for their steak.,0
I called and emailed them many times for two days. Nobody answered my calls or emails. Nobody picked up the phone any time I called. I don't know how their ice cream is but their customer service and communication is clearly poor.,0
Really cool rainbow lights when you drive down the freeway at the evening time. Parking seem to be really difficult unless you want to pay the price for VIP designs are really fast.,0
Food was good bar food. Had the wings and the nachos. Service was horrible. The bartender had to pickup the slack for our worthless waitress.,0
"Great food and fabulous service. Sad to leave food on the plate, bit the portions are huge.",0
"Good hotel experience. Close to airport. Clean property with very friendly service. A bit sprawled out, but on site transportation is easily available. Good gym. Heavenly brunch. Try the huevos rancheros!",0
Best food I ate during my 5 day stay in Vegas by far.,0
Food has always been delicious every time that I have gone here. Unfortunately the service is not very good. I only return because I love the food.,0
"They were supposed to design and  build our booth, a big one. TWO weeks before the event they said they could not work on it and did not have anything ready. I would not recommend working with them.",0
All you can eat BBQ! The steamed egg was the best dish. The marinated foods were really sweet.,0
Overall its a pretty cool place. Cold beer and good wings but the service us hit or miss and some if the bands bring in a rough croud.,0
"Good service, good beer selection, very good pizza. I'll be back.",0
"I usually go for sunday brunch, so can't speak for the dinners",0
"This place is amazing! The food is delicious, the place is clean and the service is lightning fast! I have absolutely no complaints I'll definitely be back!",0
This place is great. Never a bad experience here. Consistent good food and consistent good service. A great go-to breakfast spot.,0
It is a coffee shop. also sells yogurt. WiFi did not work. If you need your fix it is better than nothing,0
This place has horrible service! That's straight to the point! Never coming here again!!!! Not worth the aggravation!!,0
"This place is great. Refreshingly different, good atmosphere, well made drinks and reasonable prices.\n\nCouldn't give the full 5 because of the location - it isn't close to anything.",0
"Wow rudest staff ever, place seemed pretty nice but the lady who \""greeted\"" us was so rude we left shortly after we walked in",0
"Coffee is good, atomshere is nice, can get  a little noisy, the back room is good for small meetings.",0
This is a cute bar. Pretty small. Wish it attracted a younger crowd..felt really out of place.,0
Do not go here at all. The people that run this place are not nice to customers at all.,0
Awesome pizza awesome place.  this is a must eat while in vegas.  the people here rock!!!!,0
The best jiffy lube I ever went to. All 3 staffs took a time and check everything they can. They were so fast and professional. I felt bad that they were all sweating for my old car. Thank you.,0
"They close at 9:30 on Fridays? Are you kidding me? If you have to turn away business because you're closing, worse shoo away the customers you have, something is wrong.",0
"I love this salon. Vivian and Sally are amazing. They do a really great job and fast. They always fit me in same day. I am a perfectionist, and my nails look amazing. Eyebrows too ;)",0
"Awesome experience, I've only been there twice but I just moved across the street. I know I'll be in more often, they seem consistent.",0
"First time here. Nice atmosphere. Food was tastee, and big size meals. Left really full. The only thing I didn't like was No Free Refills on soda. Otherwise great food!",0
Great old world service! Use Priceline to book your room. Become an Omni rewards member before you arrive to avoid the wifi fee ($10/night). Food and the room service rocks!,0
Old fashioned cafe. Simple meat and three menu plus a bunch of sandwiches. \nMassive amount of food. \nMost of patrons work nearby.,0
"It ain't what it used to be. On two occasions I was \""greeted\"" by door guys that must have mistakenly thought they were bouncers at an L.A. Nightclub.",0
I love this place. My husband and I were able to share a meal because the portions are so big. The food is amazingly delicious.,0
Stopped in here for a quick hand wash.  I had them wash my black car on the side rather than running it through the tunnel.  For $25 not a bad job.  A few swirl marks but overall pretty good.,0
The service is horrendous. Went there numerous times and my orders have been messed up.,0
amazing italian food and great service. I can't wait to go back.,0
"Has everything you could need, helpful staff, big parking lot.",0
Best pizza joint around. And there is some good pizza in this neighborhood. Wife had mia minis. There little cinnamon bites with icing side. Nice little treat.,0
I give this McDonald's 5 stars comparing it to other McDonalds restaurants in the Las Vegas/ Henderson area. service is fast whether you're in the drive-thru or ordering inside..,0
gmo..... up the wazoooo eat this and die..!!! not a good thing 4 you or your children..... Or U 4 that Matter...:////,0
"I had a spring salad and my friend had a welcoming breakfast. Both of them are great! If they can use a bigger bowl for salad, it will be better because it is hard to toss the salad in a small bowl.",0
Very popular and I have no idea why. Strictly there\ndue to being other people's choice. Many years and locations. Boring,0
Love this place don't even have to get out of your car.,0
pretty high turnover of furniture and housewares.  still looking for a bookshelf.,0
This was so good and cant wait to come back best orange chicken ever with chow main noodles,0
"What a cool store. It's so trendy and chic that it's almost intimidating! The sales people are chatty and polite, allowing customers to simply 'hang out' on the displayed furniture.",0
I picked up a nice computer desk at a really good price here. I absolutely love the unique items that come from all over the world.,0
"pretty good, the eggtarts are bomb, service was good. typical dim sum place, gets the job done",0
Was there Friday morning around 9am- rudest young guy working the order window and took our payment. That guy has no business in the customer service industry.,0
"The worst experience in eating out.  Worst food, restaurant owner from hell, rude and grumpy.  Will never set foot in that place again.",0
"Avoid this place!  Rip off, rude, incompetent.  If you do go here, look around at how there's no one else in the shop, and the empty garage.  Turn around and leave before they touch your vehicle.",0
"Not bad...older machines, but my clothes got clean, not like Rancho Dr. Laundromat, clothes felt gross and smelled nasty!  This place was good!",0
"Good hummus, I had the cornish hen which was pretty good. my husbands beef dish was unimpressive. the wait staff was wonderful. maybe we need to try an alternate dish next time.",0
9:20pm and chair's all up on tables. Had to stand outside!,0
I go here all the time. The spicy chicken parmesan sausages from the meat counter are awesome!\n\nWish they had a salad bar,0
I went with my family to breakfast at this diner. I ordered a veggie omelette it was very good. Basic diner. Nice atmosphere. Love the fact they had flavored creamer for my coffee. Coffee was so so.,0
The portions were small and the prices were high.  I really didn't see a distiction between this type of food and any number of small indian places.,0
"I stopped in here to pick up some Birks for Lauren and they had a decent selection. Service was ok, nothing outstanding but also not the worst I have had either.  I would shop here again.",0
I wasn't impressed but tried going three different times. Food is ok service is fair and cost is a little much for what you get.,0
"Food was bad.  Charges for rice.  Service was meh.  Ordered fried chicken wings.  It came out soggy, nasty, and bloody--was utterly disgusting.  Would not recommend, ever...",0
"Trendy, but coffee leaves something to be desired. Location is good though and the decor is novel. Okay place, but way overhyped, I don't get it.",0
"All hail the Queens and Kings of Nerds!\n\nI can say that with no malice as not only am I an alumna, but I was president of the chess club.",0
"Went there for the schezuan. The food was way too salty. The spice was ok, i didn't think it was flavorful.",0
"Good ice cream place with a hypster coffee shop vibe.  Take it out or sit in.  Smooth, creamy texture,  clean non-overpowering flavor.",0
"Love it, almost every time to Vegas got to have dim sum at Cathay House. Everything is good! don't miss it.",0
Great service and atmosphere.  The food is good - comfort food for the soul.,0
"This club is pretty small, and rather interesting. \n\nBe sure to check out Midget night here!",0
"Best fast food Mexican place around. food is freshly cooked, inexpensive and delicious. Beats Robertos for sure. Not a fancy place but if you want excellent Mexican food, this is the place to go!",0
Good place to grab a slice of your favorite pizza for a couple bucks.  Can't go wrong with options like that!,0
A small coffee is now $2.50 \n\n\n\nLol.,0
"Not exactly French food, but very satisfying.  Huge meatballs and a seriously tasty burger for a fair price will have my friends and I return.",0
Getting charged for ranch when it comes with your meal is ridiculous. Who orders chicken strip dry? Also the people there are rude.,0
"As their company name says, they are very careful movers. They moved a heavy piano with no difficulty, and no damage to walls or piano. I would highly recommend them.",0
The wings suck. I love good wings and these just aren't. Service was mediocre at best. Won't go back.,0
Great place to go for great beer and amazing food. It is really hard to have a group larger then 6 to get a table together sense they really don't allow reservations.,0
Can this place get an order correct the 1st time? I think not!,0
Not impressed with the onion rings... too greasy with an unpleasant aftertaste. Also spider web decoration during halloween became a nuisance.,0
"Alot of food, resonably priced great service.  Parking can be a challenge at times.",0
"Basic simple food, very inexpensive, but good. Great value. Bring cash, they don't take cards.",0
Great european style boutique hotel.  You can not beat this hotel for the money!,0
The staff is nice. Big selection. Cleaned and tightened my old pair while I was shopping for a new one.,0
Not impressed by this place at all. The bartenders were not friendly at all and the place looked like a dump. Not suprised since it was off Grand.,0
super americanized chinese food. maybe I ordered the wrong thing (see pic),0
Bojangles is awesome in this airport. Great chicken sandos!,0
Cult vibes + delicious lemongrass mock chicken. I try to avoid meat substitutes in general these days but Veggie House holds a special place in my heart.,0
"Great margaritas, but kinda pricy for what they have. Their food isn't all that special :(",0
It's great because it was a weekday and no one else was there. :),0
"This  place was incredible!  For $20 I got a huge delicious prime rib with bread, side salad and baked potato.  We will definitely be going back to this place next time we are in Vegas!",0
Fair is stretching it.  The ribeye was a low grade supermarket cut.  Not on my list to revisit in the future!,0
I can't say enough about the service here. We had an issue the manager came right out apologized and gave us a free meal.. I will be back..,0
"Love the food, but we get take out to the office and every time its a bit of an ordeal.  \n\nEat in.  If you're planning on take out make it simple.",0
"The Place is first full of Ghettos. \nIt's very Loud, unclean and humans there buy everything.\nI mean there are always empty Shelves. Never again.",0
Fair. Honest. that is hard to find in a mechanic. Knowledgeable,0
THis place has great wings and its a cool hole in the wall type feel.  You can tell this place has its regulars as the servers knew people by name.  I will definitely be back for more wings and cocktails!!,0
Worst salsa I have ever tasted. They also would not modify the menu to fit my request. What kind of place doesn't modify a menu for a customer. I will not return!,0
Say they open at 8am...sitting here at 10 after and locked/shuttered. Can't open on time?,0
Have been here twice and its was just ok.,0
The liquor board needs to do something about this place. The owner is a complete intoxicated fool and it's becoming a problem. Stay away.,0
"With all that hype about this restaurant, I was excited about going there. But hmm it was just... how can I put it? Meh! Didn't do it for me. I would rather go to Daphne's.",0
We are regulars and tonight disappointed that the cornmeal style crust was not presented.  Hope this is not the end of our normalcy!,0
"Out of the way, hole in the wall type restaurant.  Food was yummy & service was great.",0
They charge more than the services they provide are worth.  Since they currently have a monopoly on cable tv in the madison area there is nothing anyone can do about it.,0
This place is awesome! Food and drinks are A+,0
"I ate and drank at the lounge here during a recent summer stay at the Buttes.   I My favorite is the chips - the ones with bacon, blue cheese, and chipotle sauce...YUMM!",0
Not only was the food wonderful but the staff are friendly.  The ribs are sooooo tender and the red beans & rice are fabulous.  The cornbread is YummmmmY.,0
"I really like the pizza and they deliver! It's a nice thin greasy style pizza. The toppings are a little scarce, but the price is good. Don't order sausage.",0
Good food. Kind pricey as they charge for the extras.,0
No coffee here this morning.\nI pop in now and then because it's right by my work but they don't always have coffee ready.,0
i don't understand why this place always gets such good reviews everywhere. i guess the fact that it's not panda express or pei wei gets it some bonus points but honestly the food isn't that great.,0
It's pretty average Chinese food. Their egg rolls and dumplings were decent enough as was the Hawaii Five O dish I had was ok too. The service is a little slow as well.,0
The food is of poor quality. The crust is close to cardboard. The salad did not taste good. The server asked us if we wanted more drinks and and we had to ask again to get them. We won't be returning.,0
Terrible service. Two days in a row they screwed up two different shipments. Not sure how they stay in business with such incompetence.,0
"Meh. Friday night and they have tons of pre cooked pizza sitting there. Not fresh, salad that came in the combo was decent.",0
I'm not a fan but I enjoy drinking at the bar area. So if you're coming to drink... not so bad. If you're coming to eat...  ah you might think again!,0
I'd rather drive to c3 or castle Shannon to hit the drive threw. Fast food isn't fast when u have to walk in. Desperately needs a remodel.,0
Awesome bargains and prices! I have found a new shopping spot without having to feel guilty.,0
"Horrible service by an overworked, tired looking, grouchy waitress named TRACY. \nSlow service, cold food, Just Awful!",0
We saw the chef dump used chili sauce back into the container on the table after the customers left. Bleh :(,0
I was here for about 20 min... but at least it wasn't a bad 20 min?,0
There is a reason this restaurant has over 60 reviews. It might not look like the greatest neighborhood but Great food at an affordable price!\nThe place was quite clean and droned a nice ambiance as well!,0
But they are improving and the rodeo burger is back. Even with that though it is still the worst fast food around.,0
Very clean and they do a good job too! \n\nI like that they scrub the car before it goes through the machine..nice touch!\n\nI'll definitely be back!,0
I still go here and I still love them. Manny is the best in customer service!,0
"The place is kind of a maze. If you're wanting a party it's not ideal, it separates everyone. If you want dancing it's not enough room. Great food and the employees are ok. They kind of rush you though.",0
"The BBQ chicken was very tasty. The fries, cole slaw, and roll were not with the calories. Don't forget to bring cash as that is the only currency that is allowed. The service was excellent and very responsive.",0
Very stylish restaurant with a great street view. Food can be on the spicier side here which is a plus. Worth checking out based on the price point.,0
We ventured to Feedbag tonight and were not impressed with the food. The service was very good and portion sizes were nice but the instant macaroni and cheese and instant mashed potatoes left us disappointed.,0
A great quilt shop!  They serve hot apple cider during the winter months.  Very helpful employees and a vast selection of Civil War and Kansas Troubles fabrics.  Great shop for making a folk art quilt.,0
Its clean its fast its good food that wont break the bank :),0
"My first time in Vegas and this was a great place to finish up my trip. Great selection, people, and price. Best hidden gem in Vegas.",0
Seriously you must go here if in Vegas! It's a short walk from Fremont but worth it. So much fun! Cheap prices too!,0
Pete has been my dad's barber for over a decade. I make the trip here just to see him.,0
"Food is great I can't say much for the service and the hostess who upon arriving welcomed us with a \""what!\""",0
"Took forever to be seen even though I was the only one there. When they transitioned to FastMed, no patient info was transferred, had to fill out all the paperwork again. Scale said I was fat. That's it.",0
They have changed owners and we do not go there. They do not go out of their way to help you in a crunch. No need for them with so many other places to choose from.,0
The service was extra terrible today. I can usually deal with it but today was just bad.,0
Got a full set today and they look so bad. So many flaws. The polish is sloppy. They don't look neat and clean.,0
This place is a hidden treasure. I have visited quite a few times and have yet to be disappointed. The steak is delicious and the sides have great flavor. A great value for the quality of food.,0
"Horrible service, greasy food, orders always incorrect.   Go elsewhere!!",0
Great bunch of people...I've gone there for years.  Just got a call from CVS they are taking over their prescriptions!  What??  What happened to them?  Why did they close?  I'm NOT happy!!,0
What happened to the Mineos I remember? The sauce tasted SOUR and the crust like cardboard. I'm so very disappointed because this used to be my #1 pizza place.,0
Great food. I would give it 5 stars if they took credit/debit cards.,0
"This jeweler was voted best of the valley!? I really do not see why. The salespeople are pushy and the selection caters to \""grandma\""",0
"The cheesesteak was edible. The service was grumpy. \n\nThis is Oakland we're talking about, so no surprises there. \n\nI give it 2 greasy stale buns out of 5.",0
"Decent. Service is a little better than most dim sum places, but that's not saying much. The food is just okay. The fried rice is probably the best compared to other local dim sum places.",0
"Good stuff but only worth it with coupons for free entree when you buy one and it is still pricey, they really get you on the price of the coffee.",0
"Remind me why I revisited this place again after many years?\n\nOh yeah! It must be so that I can briefly say, \""Meh. I've experienced better\""",0
Very greasy and food tastes like it was not fresh and prepared and frozen.  Bbq meat tasted old.,0
No bacon on my Bacon and Cheese Quarter Pounder!!!!! Kind of an essential ingredient for that particular burger....,0
Delicious! This is the best gyro place in the C-U and the best gyro place ever. The quality of the food is amazing. The portions are generous and the prices are reasonable.,0
Gross... the only great thing about my meal was the chedder biscuits. I knew by the look of my meal when it came to the table I was going to get food poisoning. I WAS RIGHT.,0
"I've been to other Joes & around the country and this one is the pittssss.. charging double for fish they ran out of... keep away tourist trap.. and the king grab,nothing to cut it with..",0
The store is a joke And mismanaged. Every time I want to buy a door a window or carpeting there's never a person available to help and I always go across the street to Lowe's and i can place an order.,0
My neighborhood place. Good ppl good food.,0
Cheap but that's it.  Buses do not run as frequent as other lots,0
This place sucks. The service is horrible. The hostess this evening (Feb 11) was horrible: rude and detached. The Manager was worse. Do not patronize this restaurant unless you have money to burn and time to kill.,0
Very  very  nice  spot  great  food.,0
"Too much Spanish here. Employees are loud and obnoxious. I sat in my truck, couldn't listen to the constant bla bla any longer.",0
"If you want to get pastries while being yelled at by the staff and treated like dirt, this is the place for you.",0
this place is great one of my favorite happy hours and if you sit in the dinning room they crack all of your shellfish at our table get the shrimp san remo and ask for extra bread for dipping!,0
"I ordered the Bourbon chicken and shrimp. It tasted super good. I was disappointed a little, because it comes with saut\u00e9ed onions and \""mushrooms\"". I got no mushrooms",0
This is where all of the village idiots work.,0
"Drove up to Europa to pick up some cakes for a party, store was empty and no sign in the window.",0
Great Place to listen to some blues. Drinks are always great as well. Very small though. Hopefully they can expand someday soon. I'd love to see them expand.,0
All excited about the tostadas. When I received them they were ice cold. The only reason for the three stars was the service was super friendly.,0
Friendly service. Great food. Best part was I got my food right after I got done paying. Fast Service!!!,0
Best dentist in town! Great office and staff. You feel right at home.,0
Pretty good selection of food and beer here. the burger i had was pretty good. the wait staff was pretty friendly. Overall a pretty good place,0
Delicous Mexican food at a great price! Love the green chili tamales and chicken chimichangas! Endless chips and salsa are delicious as well.,0
"Slow service! Didnt really feel like I was a valued guest. I think I would feel better spending my money somewhere else, like the Dennys across the street. Then the waitress double charged our cards.",0
"Don't get me wrong, this IS a college bar but the food is great and inexpensive. Excellent mozzarella sticks! Awesome sliders! Yummy wings! Bueno nachos! Tasty fries!",0
"Cheap gambling, strong drinks. \n\n... very strong.",0
Service was slow..staff was inattentive and nothing was done when we complained.won't be back.,0
I would have never waked into this placE without the reviews from Yelp and man am I glad I did. Great food served up in a shed. Will return.,0
"I used to rate this 5 stars.  It was worth driving across town for.  Now, the scoops are much smaller and the flavor has changed.  Not worth the money, the calories or the drive!",0
I took a few corporate colleagues from San Jose California here one night for dinner.  The food was good.  It was a bit loud though.,0
"Good home cooked food. Family ran, great seafood dishes and ok salsa bar (lunch only). Love the big shrimp tacos. Lunch time is good with a self serve salsa bar.",0
The food was good and our waitress was amazing. The menus were dirty and other customers were very loud. The wait on our food was a little longer then usual but it was worth the wait.,0
Nice job on dry cleaned pants and cheap. but laundered shirts always come out wrinkiled.  I take pants there and shirts elsewhere and pay a bit more so i won't have to worry about touch up at home on the shirts.,0
Terrible service. Love when the bartenders are drinking more than you. Not to mention harass you about playing the machines,0
Super Busy Airport. Every gate is packed. Food lines are off the hook. SFO is huge and I have never seen so many long lines. Need some expansion.,0
"Fly in my food, enough said. Only giving them two stars instead of one because their flavors were good. Would've been good had I not seen the fly. -.-",0
"Good little neighborhood restaurant, we frequent it often for takeout and eat there every Christmas with my Jewish family. A Sunnyslope treasure!",0
"Very nice grocery store indeed. Everything is well organized and not messy at all. The fruits were definately of decent quality, well it better for the cost. This is one of my top grocery store for sure.",0
Expect the slowest service you have ever seen.  3 hours for a meal on a Sunday night.,0
I've been going to plasma for a few years now met some amazing friends. This place is really awesome! It really is the gay Cheers!,0
Went to this restraunt it was terrible.  Service was horrible I think her name was Denice.  Food was very dry not to mention when I got home and all this morning I have been sick.,0
"great philly cheesesteak, hot bbq wings, fries, pizza. Good place to drink that is not a bar.",0
Lots of factory made crap here. Also tried to refuse a plastic bag but the lady just had to give me one.,0
Great for take out only. There place is too small for a sour down restaurant.  Their spicy tuna sucked.,0
Some of the best views from a golf course in the valley!!!  I will be playing this a few times a year and I only play about 8-10 times each year.,0
Overpriced goods but the staff is nice. SRP pay center in this store is handy.,0
Good food but the young staff can never get any to go order right. They are too busy talking about their social life,0
Great food that really touches the soul. Love the fried chicken with their hot sauce. The waffles are excellent. Must order the fried okra and cheese grits.,0
"Great atmosphere on the patio. Servers were friendly and attentive. Food was good! I got the carne adobada plate. It was a  huge portion, plenty of left overs. Would definitely go back!!",0
Waiting 20 minutes to get one piece of wood cut in an empty store on a Friday afternoon.  Priceless!,0
Always friendly staff. Never too busy. Probably my favorite Starbucks in Vegas.,0
I love this place!! Staff is nice! The drive-thru is usually busy so if I'm in a hurry I go inside and I'm in and out quickly!! Also love the app...I get free stuff quite often!!,0
"it awful, dirty, and food is gross and not cooked!!!!!!it is not clean!!!!They do not clean tables, or replace items, they leave left over food on forks, glasses dirty, place is gross.",0
Service is great. Outside seating in mild weather is awesome. Chicken Mac and Sausage Mac were both great. Veggie pizza was fresh and yummy. Beer sampler was fun to try!,0
This is my favorite place to eat when I'm visiting family. The best pizza and the most amazing mozzarella sticks. I like the ambiance. Eating here makes me nostalgic for my childhood. You definitely won't go wrong.,0
Thai crunch salad is pretty good and the artichoke dip is pretty good as well. Give them a try if your in the neighborhood.,0
"I've been to it a few times over the years, and I've never had a major issue with this store. I tried the new Chicken Bacon Wrap and it was tasty. If in the area and hungry, I would return.",0
Service was very friendly. But this location needs a deep cleaning. It is very dirty with dirty bathrooms. Cleanliness is not a priority for this location,0
"1 simple word go this Circle K. \""Ghetto\"" horrible corner spot, homeless and drug addicts often come at night, pumps seem to never work!",0
"New to the area and have ordered from them twice. The pizza is good, but overpriced, in my opinion. Everyone raves about the garlic knots...they were good, not great, just good.",0
Food is ehhhh. Nothing special but gets the job done. Huge menu with a lot of options.,0
It's cheap and is open at 6 a.m.  This is pretty much the only pros I can think of this place.,0
"I love this petco! It is clean, near my house and the staff is awesome! They have adoptions weekly I believe for dogs which is always nice. The staff is very helpful, anytime I need something they are eager to help.",0
"I found my fringed leather jacket here and even though my sixteen year old son says, \""I look confused\""  I'm a happy camper",0
"filled with flies everywhere, not matter if it is in a nice area, it is still covered with flies.\nIt is zoo bad, it is on your food and walls and everywhere.",0
"Just got a small, pre-made chicken salad sandwich and a cup of chicken chili from the Fifth Avenue store, and paid over $9. You can get much better quality and value elsewhere in Pittsburgh.",0
"I was pretty nervous about going here because of some of the reviews, since I've never been there before. The fees definitely suck but it really wasn't that bad, I have been to venues that were much worse.",0
Wow people in this store are rude. I was in there exactly 2 minutes and was shocked at how rude the print lady was.  Not gonna go there again.,0
"Food was very good. Fagiole had nice hint of thyme, and cannelloni was quite hearty. Decor only so-so. Staff friendly and helpful.",0
Said was open at 4. Went to the bar around 415  and wasn't opened. Pretty disappointed.,0
"This place is good, service is good, pizza is good. The price is ok, the building is getting a little worn down. \n\nThere is only an outside table to eat there. Nothing inside.",0
"Even with almost nobody in the hall, it took an hour for the food to come out.\n\nI would not recommend this resturant.",0
"Meh, not the \""best\"" by far concerning the pizza. Like the fresh tomatoes but lacking in flavor from the other toppings. Maybe it's cause the crust is too heavy. There are better options especially in scottsdale.",0
"Nice community, coffee served after mass in the morning which is nice and sometimes food.\n\nMass bread is a little thick.",0
"I only stopped here for a case of beer since I drove by it... usually I prefer Total Wine.  I will give Lee's that they have more locations, but it's not as good of a selection or price as Total Wine.",0
i have not been here in a while but when i did go the food was rather good not too expensive at all i would return to this location,0
"The coffee really isn't that good, but the variety on the menu is decent.  I have bad memories of teenage angst and if that is what you are looking for then you found it in The Beehive",0
I just expect so much more in wings especially when the place is named after it. Can't really say anything about the food. Never impressed. The beer is cold and great for watching Football.,0
I use to go here. But I really think they water down their drinks.,0
"Terrible pizza, tasted like it was from a box. Bread tasted like it was from a bag.\nGave it a try twice, will not come back.",0
As close as your gonna get to home!!! Old school feel also!!,0
best downtown hotel!...great hosts..host Jason very helpful!,0
Breakfast at 2:30....  Holla!,0
"Nice atmosphere, the building was converted from an old car wash. The pizza is decent. Cheeseburger pizza is our favorite, it's really really good.",0
"Cheap stuff, not so great selection for tall people.  Long lines to check out.  Snotty staff.",0
"Stinks off smoke, bad waitress service, average to poor food.  This is a dive bar without any off the virtues of a dive bar.",0
"Love coming here.  Great service, neat little grocery area (more eclectic stuff than actual groceries), and the food is awesome (simple menu but delicious).",0
"It's simple, if you end up here you made a bad decision. The promoter offered us free drinks, and free rides and we got neither of those. When you confront the staff they  blow you off and your instantly to intoxicated.",0
Terrible salad as lettuce was wilted a bit.  Steak was so filled with marbleing that it was ineatable.  The cup of water was good.,0
"Orderd pizza on line got a 16\"" sausage and extra cheese pizza, came nice and hot, got it in 38 min. Perfect. Loved it!!!",0
Ordered fettuccine Alfredo and the sauce was completely separated. It looked like butter and curdled cheese. I would not recommend this place.,0
"I had the Spaghetti alla Capri, it could of been better.\nmy husband had Pizza with sausage and mushroom he said it was good",0
I got food poisoning here. It was the worst experience of my life. Don't eat the chicken!,0
Wow not impressed wit the mens clothing prices. There a whole bunch of higher end store with this price range. The store crew was amazing and helpful! Really nice people.,0
"No bathroom, uhhh what kind of gas station is this but however there are two redboxes.",0
gross. This place is widely known as the toilet of all strip clubs.,0
"Holy shit this place is hilarious. The food is overpriced, the portions are tiny, and the taste is too salty. The only upside is that the food came out pretty fast but only 3 parties were here. Don't come here",0
"A \""quality\"" experience but it lacks intimacy, the service can be detached and the room nioisy. There are also too few good tables.",0
I have found them to be less than accomodating or helpful.,0
Meh. What's all the hype about? It's hard to believe it's run by the same people as Monty's diner because the service and food quality are so much lower. Not worth the wait.,0
The Margaritas are pretty good and the torilla chips come complimentary which makes it all the better. The appetizer combo was not the greatest so I will deduct a star for that.,0
Looking for a tuxedo shirt? Maybe an apron that looks like a fat Elvis? No? How about some playing cards or key chains? This place has EVERY souvenir you can possibly think of and more!,0
Just a basic  joint serving basic food. It's about as worn-out as the food they serve. Good place to go for the stuff you could prepare at home.,0
"Had a great happy hour there. Staff are very nice and helpful. This place attracts good people. Shepard's pie is delicious, so is their fish and chips.",0
This was a cool dive bar.. too bad we got there in time for only round before they closed.. fun crowd!,0
"relaxing, very good location.  little cramped with small tables",0
Plenty of Bull going on behind the scenes at this establishment,0
"I went through the drive through at 1:15 am and drove away with my food at 1:50 am, no joke. It would have been faster to park and walk into the Walmart McDonald's.",0
Keep up all the good work at the Humane Society.,0
Love this place!! Really good ranch and wings. their 6inch pizza is perfect for one. Great tasting. Good clean place to eat and the service is good,0
"Gorgeous. Definitely worth a visit, especially with the Chihuly exhibit installations. I love this place & go at least twice a year!",0
Not bad for a quick lunch before work.  I had the ribs and they were good! Which is more than I can say for the BBQ restaurants I have eaten at here in Las Vegas,0
"I enjoy stopping by after shooting hoops Sunday nights. The store is well ran. Clean store, fast service. No surprise that they have a line to the door at 9 pm on Sunday nights.",0
"About $8 a sandwich.  A little out of the way.  The philly cheese steak was good.  As always, I threw in peppers.  Yum.",0
More of a tourist attraction.  Food is better elsewhere for the cost.,0
Staff made you feel as if they were doing you a favor by waiting on you. Owner on the phone and didn't even acknowledge the customer.  Food was awful. Will never go back,0
"Love this theater! The management team was great when I had a special request, couldn't ask for better customer service.",0
"This place has excellent pastries, easily as good as anything you will get from similar places in Los Angeles.",0
"Its basically the \""How I met Your Mother Bar\"" A place where you go to sit, talk, and have a beer. Good Irish Stout. Super-Hipster-Artsy. Friendly staff.",0
Most every negative stereotype that exists as a part of lesser apartment living will be present here. 2 stars for nice front office staff,0
"I have always enjoyed the wings at these restaraunts, and it is low key and casual. It's not a sports bar, but there are usually games on the flat screens, so its just a nice wing and beer place.",0
"Good prices on produce. Cashier told me that my receipt was in my bag & it wasn't, & she didn't say thank you or anything when she finished with me. Quite rude I think!",0
"well, the place looks legit from the outside......",0
Cute place. But way over priced with poor quality food. Huevos Rancheros $10 with uncooked retried beans and cold dark red pasty rice.,0
Ordered a French Dip for delivery. When I received my order I noticed that all of the Dipping Sauce had spilled into the bag. Sandwich was still good though. They could probably be more cautious when delivering food however.,0
"I love the bagels here. They are tasty and always taste fresh. I would eat here for breakfast every weekend if I could! \n\nHowever, some locations are better than others- they are not always consistent.",0
mmmmm....yummy food! Did not except such good food to be honest.,0
"Great coffee, nice ambiance, ecclectic crowd, I went in planning to people watch state street while enjoying a caffeine boost and spent most of my time eavesdropping on the bizarre conversations going on around me...very entertaining.",0
"Main course was great app was bad... The manager was not very interested in my opinion on app. Her comment was \""well that's how we make them here. \""",0
Two words: soggy pizza.  Service is the only reason I am giving two stars instead of one.,0
Had the chicken Marsala. Pretty good. I would go back.,0
"Come here to fill yourself up with veggies, simple pastas, soups and some soft serve ice cream.  Each location is the same and you can have your food exactly the way you want!",0
"Indoors the dining area has a chill cave feel, outside has a nice little stream. Local beer on tap, the food has a strong kick so order with caution.",0
"I like the buffet, but that's about it. The slots are tighter than a frog's asshole, and the place is smokier than hell.",0
Some of the worst food I have ever had I would never recomend this to anyone.  Go to Sakana or Hiro Sushi,0
"One of the best pizzas I have eaten. Soft, crispy, a little burned on top. Absolutely delicious! 10\"" for 8 bucks and 22 oz Coors light for $3.50, what a deal!",0
Best Bean and Cheese and Large Strips in the world. Been coming here for since 93 and have never eaten anything that wasn't good! PERIOD.,0
"There is nothing not to like about this place, great sandwiches and a friendly staff of people working behind the counter.  Forget about the chains and give this place a try you willl be glad you did.",0
This is a great place to eat! The people there are so nice and the food is fantastic. They have some of the best cornbread I've had and the catfish and chicken are fried to golden perfection but deliciously moist.,0
I went to Pheasant as a guest of a member. This is undoubtedly the nicest place I have ever smoked a cigar in. I would purchase a membership if it were in a more convenient location for me.,0
"What a great sports bar. Lots of TVs, great atmosphere, and great food. Try the telluride burger, wings, or foccocia. For dessert the cookie platter is the best.",0
"Best fish sticks and chips in downtown Glendale, and I only had to wait 45 minutes!",0
"Food was passable, while service was tolerable. Out of steak sauce? Really. Double fries looked barely enough for a single order of fries.  Then they charged us twice!",0
Amazing pizza and calzones.  the crust is so crispy and the sauce is great.  I'm from the east coast and this really feels like I'm back there,0
I do not understand why this place has such low review:(I really love their lunch!! It is not L' Etoile stuff...but it is very nice food...and ambience casual and friendly.,0
Terrible service! The wait is endless and my order is never correct. This isn't the first time! Terrible service!,0
"Waited 50 minutes for food, with no explanation or apology.  Rather defensive waitress offered us drink refills when one of our party complained.  \n\nWill not be stopping here again.",0
"Lose all your money at the tables if you must, but don't lose your dignity by eating here.",0
"Update from last review.  Just found out today after having my car checked out at the dealer that Fletchers installed my head-gasket incorrectly, it is leaking oil from the engine seam.",0
"It's a sports bar... I've heard the wings were good, but the bad hip-hop was too loud to be worth staying for more than one glass",0
Went there this week and everyone who had the beans got food poisoning for 2 days. Will never go there again!,0
Food was ok. Ordered to go. When I got home I saw that the order was wrong and food was missing. I guess you get what you pay for.,0
Thought I would give them a 2nd chance... Bad idea! Employees make you feel like your putting them out for ordering overpriced pizza. this place will be out of business If  the owners don't  make a change quickly.,0
"Oddly smells like popcorn..but in that \""covering up a smell\"" bad way.",0
"They accidentally put cow cheese on my pizza (which I am allergic to), but then they felt so bad they comped out whole meal for a party of 9. Super hospitable and accommodating! Thank you Sammie's crew.",0
Everything is salty and the portions are HUGE along with the price. Always consistent but I feel like I always have eaten poorly.,0
"Yeah, they have hams and whatnot, but it's a good place for lunch too--their sandwiches rock.",0
The food was over priced for the quality. The appetizers were a joke. I and my boyfriend both have been puking foam since we ate here. I'll gladly never eat here again,0
"Rate Beer: Fair (where's the hops in the IPA) \nService: Great, very nice   \nAtmosphere: Good.  I like the beer garden.",0
"Everyone I have encountered has been very nice, welcoming and helpful.\nI loved every minute.  The massages I got were AMAZING!!!!!!",0
I found broken and chipped items on shelves priced high. clothing is at least 2 $ more then Cali. \n\ni go from thrift store to thrift store wherever i happen to be. So I thought Vegas why not?,0
"Worst dumplings I've had in my life. The skin is so thick, and the filings fall out like a rock.  I can make playdough dumplings that taste better than this.",0
This place is average. Lots of food. Speedy staff. It's a casual buffet. Great for business lunches,0
Believe the DDD hype. The calzone was perfect. Pizza was great. Service was some of the best and friendliest ever. They do not rest on their laurels. A must try.,0
"Really. Good. Pizza.  Great variety of beer and wine.  If you are in downtown, and want a good meal, eat here.",0
Large portions. Great bread sticks. Chicken parmesan was top quality.,0
"Good diner-type food. Friendly service. Really good milkshakes. Nice family atmosphere. Cute decor. \n\nI would definitely recommend this, especially as a casual dinner spot for families.",0
Don't ever get the trout taco special.  They are crap!!!  Cabo fish taco has really gone down hill lately.  The service is good the food is crap!!!,0
"When I am having a sugar craving after busting out a gargantuan trail run, I hit this place up. Muffins, cupcakes, all sorts of gluttony inducing items.",0
"Good basic American food. The prime rib is tasty, tender and juicy. They serve it with a horseradish sauce upon request.",0
"The food is decent, the service is better than your average Madison restaurant and the bathrooms were clean.  It is a bit out of our way but it is consistent enough to warrant more visits.",0
If you ever been traveling in the Middle East you will be hardly disappointed... \nLooked so forward to it but the food didn't had a lot of taste.,0
Met the owner a few times and it was obvious he is enthusiastic about his business. Babes is a nice neighborhood place.,0
Went there to meet a friend.  Didn't think I'd make a friend in Gaetano.  Reminds me of my father; but with cooking skills.\n\nBest food off of the strip!,0
a glam dive bar....looks nice inside and some times they have good offers for girls.,0
Most expensive Sam Woo that I've ever been to.  Easily 40% more them other places.  My noodle was extra salty too.  Cash only. Portions are way smaller than other Sam Woo.,0
"The host was an old italian man who was very very rude. The bread was stale, calamari overlooked place was terrible",0
"I love this place. \nMy girls and I are always here.  Taro balls, snow white snow ice and tea-flavored spiced pork chop are my favorites.",0
The waitress was super slow so much so we abandoned our table and walked up to the bar. The food was medi-ocre and overpriced. The bartender on the other hand was pretty good. I give him 3 1/2 stars.,0
"This was probably one of the worst places I've eaten at in a while. I'm not sure what was worse food or service. Never again, the coupon we bought and weren't allowed to use left on the table",0
Simply put. Order the food not the pizza.,0
"Pricey, but that is what you get for good food at a classy establishment. Good for happy hour specials.",0
Seafood Noodle soup had slices of pork. The cilantro garnish wasn't even chopped.,0
"Mike, the owner/cook, is awesome and the food was delicious.",0
Best chinese food so far in Vegas. It's a little more expensive than other similar restaurants but worth it.,0
"This place has a great selection of brew. Lots of unusual imports and microbrewz. The owner Phong is the shit as well, love that guy.",0
Worst pizza hut I have ever been to. We have given it several chances and no dice. The main problem is the fact that this location never seems to honor any deals that are in ads and If they do it's more expensive.,0
"The people who work here are fantastic, wonderful attitudes, genuinely care about your day and shopping experience. They also have an awesome olive selection. I got some awesome frozen veggie Phyllos and love their frozen section!",0
I enjoy the small hometown feel of the restaurant.   Food is decent and prices are good.,0
"Excellent food, however,  I wished the corned beef was homemade and not from a can. My friend had the Denver omelet which he says was first rate!",0
"Awesome spot to chill with friends. Not the busiest of bars, at least when ive been there. Pool tables and darts offered.  The selection of music you hear is very wide range.",0
Whats the owners name and I know Ms Li i don't her last name did sOmebody give me her name I'm not sure,0
"Bring your own tape and scissors.  I wasn't allowed to use theirs because of \""insurances\"", and they charged me $2 to tape my package.  Business must be slow.  FEDEX next time.",0
"The fish and chips were fine. The fish was hot, the fries were decent steak fries, and the service was prompt and knowledgeable. I would return.",0
This place would be awesome possum to go to when ur in town. I love how its nice and colorful inside. The workers there are nice and friendly with good service. The price are well priced. I would totally come here again.,0
Light Up Night.  Food has good flavor but doesn't look so hot.  If I hear about the Jackie O desert one more time I'm gonna barf.,0
...and I spent a couple of hours in our hotel bathroom that night!,0
To call this fish and chips is SOOO wrong.  Its nothing like fish and chips should be.  Go to George and Dragon in Phoenix if you want real fish and chips.  Greasy squares of fish is disgusting.,0
Service was good extremely noisy. I ordered a club sandwich with fries and was told they charge 79cents for ranch.  Are they this hard up?,0
"Giants need a new spring training park. It's cool and all, but nothing compared to the new cactus league yards. \n\nYo Yo",0
Very dirty very slow and bad customer service. They should be embarrassed. And they charged me 35 cents for mustard. WTF,0
looking so beautiful and place was awesome really son looking cafe with the great taste of food,0
"Tis good.  Very unique food.  I love the bread, it's unique.  You definitely will be full when you leave.  They also have ginger soda which is amazing.",0
Just nasty! Very cluttered and overpriced.,0
The place is very small and not very busy but the service is great. Filled my wine glass to the TOP!,0
"This place is a staple for when my preschooler needs to let out some energy and we're all hungry. Food is always fresh, service is always outstanding.",0
"One other thing:  The High Speed Internet is NOT, NOT, NOT!  You're lucky if you get 1mps.",0
"Shrimp portofino was good, but a little on the bland side. It need a little more sauce or salt. Free bread is always good! Caesar salad was ok not anything to write home about.",0
Great location by my gym. Constantly full of customers. Very efficient staff. Have never had a bad cup of coffee here.,0
Every time we go thru the drive thru. The guy that works the window always have a bad attitude like he doesn't want to be there. When we ask for green hot sauce he always seems irritated due to our request.,0
Excellent service. Chris G went above and beyond for us with new tires and even put on windshield wipers. Thank you!,0
"Dale knew just how to tune-up my old touring bike. He made good suggestions, did a great job with the workmanship, and completed ahead of schedule. Great shop!",0
"Took me three sentences to know I didn't want to shop here. When the salesman tells me to,\""Come here! \"" I can pretty much tell that he already got a pitch ready. No thanks",0
Food was decent. House chowmein was good but maybe a little oily. We both had the Mongolian beef which was decent as well. More of a 3.5 stars than just a 3.,0
Food is always good but service was poor at best today. 23 muni yes to take our lunch order..... And no more lunch specials!,0
"Need more seating, very cramped and difficult to study/work.   The pastries are dry, but the espresso is good enough.   I hope the location in Regent Square has more space.",0
I've been here give times since I landed in Vegas but my phone was always dead.. Lol I love this place their veggie pho is to die for.. Always a wait to be seated but well worth it,0
Food was on the cold side and tasted like it had been reheated... Ordered chicken marsala and got chicken in a bunch of watery sauce. Prob will not visit here again.,0
It's Walmart!  Decent stuff at cheap prices with interesting people abound.,0
"Not a bad little pub. Had the sliders, salt and pepper wings, and mushroom burger -- forgettable, but good. The fries are what I will remember, and come back for.",0
Not a bad place to go but not my first choice. The food is good but nothing unique or special.,0
"Chopped pork, corn bread, soul roll, blacked chop Delicious.  Agree greens a bit stemy but still good. Strawberry cake fair banana pudding eh. I'd go back!",0
I can't believe this place is in business. The food is worse than you find in the freezer section at Walmart.,0
You could wander for hours in this mall.  Tons of great stores all under one roof.  Just don't forget where you parked!,0
Tried to go here but it is permanently closed...Thanks for the updated info Yelp!  Drove out there and thankfully found Lenero!,0
"This is the best place to get your car washed! They care... Although no free vacuums, they dry your vehicle for no water spots. They're equipment is top notch.",0
We were here for their lunch buffet. The chicken tendori? was very tender. Coconut dessert was good. Everything was bit too salty.,0
"Located in old town Las Vegas...\n\nEverything is old, yet cheap here.\n\nDon't like how you must have a reservation here in order to park free in their parking lot.",0
Good ribs and big portions!!!  service is always good too.,0
This time the food was not as good as the first time. The meatballs were heavy & dry. The pasta sauce was just too too sweet! We were really sad to see the quality of their dishes going down,0
Every time I've been here I always see multiple health code violations. The French fries are pretty good but the Reuben made me very ill.,0
The customer service was outstanding. The food was mediocre... But my mother in law loves going here so I had to try it myself.,0
"I wish more chains had great quality foods and ambience rich environments. I thoroughly enjoyed my roasted turkey, avo blt!",0
Witnessed staff accepting cash and then making food without changing gloves or washing their hands.   Completely disgusted by this.   Not coming back to this location.,0
It is the busiest holiday week of the year and they have one man working and two broken kiosks. 1 hour wait. I would do half a star if possible.,0
best honey toast in town! love love love the short ribs!,0
Good Gas Station Location. It's near Interstate Hwy 17 and close to Anthem factory Outlets.,0
"Shopped at this location and the customer service was awesome, highly recommend this store to my friends.",0
This place id FILTHY!!! All the teenies working there need to get off their phones and maybe wipe a table off? Went for a blizzard and there was not one clean table. SERIOSLY?,0
"Stale chips, food under seasoned and their bathrooms smell horrible no thanks Super Mex.................................",0
"Not a review of the restaurant or food, just the bar.  The bar tender was awesome and fun and served up some fun drinks.  SHARK BITE!!!\n\nThanks.",0
A great location within walking distance  of the business school. The lady who runs the shop is nice and does quality timely work.,0
I got the wings. Great Sauce. Crispy Wings. The only let down was the price. $14 for a dozen wings seems a little steep. Thats like Room Service Prices.,0
This was my third time eating here and by far the best. Everything was perfectly prepared but the best of all was our waiter Sal. He was perfectly attentive without being invasive and made the evening the best ever! Thanks Sal,0
Love their corned beef and cabbage on wed. nights.,0
"Absolutely phenomenal dining experience from the service to the outstanding steak, breads and sides that accompanied our meals. I can't wait to visit again on my next trip out that way. Loved it!",0
"I got Nachos that look like a bird crapped on it, the chips were limp and soggy.\n\nThe beans were bland. \n\nPretty disappointed.",0
Excellent food. Delivered to my room at around midnight.,0
"Best place ever! The product is amazing and the is friendly, knowledgable, and made me feel welcome.",0
"Room was big and standard. Not many towels but enough. No refrigerator. The food was meh, and drinks expensive. Girls were alright, the casino didn't smell too bad.",0
"One of the coolest bar off strip. Gothic and noir theme. Drinks were pretty reasonable.  Pretty good after-hours.  The lobby is awesome, Great for hanging out with your friends.",0
Pretty good if you don't mind the crowds and you know what you're looking for.,0
"The place was horrible and food was well not very good.\nIt did have good bread sticks, pizza was atrocious. I live nearby and the place is Closed. The signs have been removed and the interior is being torn out.",0
Horrible food very salty and greasy. They forgot one of our orders but the food was so bad we canceled it and left you pay for what you get gross never again,0
If you have been to a 5 and Diner then you know what it is all about.  Chain 50s menu.  Pretty crowded the food isn't bad.,0
Not good. OCB is not a place for quality dining. It is best suited for folks who prefer quantity over quality.,0
"so happy to see a store with contemporary furniture.  Las Vegas seems to be stuck in a time warp, every store has the same style.  We need more options for more modern tastes, this store fits the bill.",0
Still one of the best places on earth to buy toys and video games.  Their selection is great and usually they have great sales right before major holidays.,0
"This place is good for breakfast, lunch, happy hour and dinner. If you're in Cave Creek AZ and looking for a casual place for good food and cold drinks, I recommend this place.",0
"Great for drinks - a haven in WI winter. \n\nThe food is not very good.  Some of the appetizers are okay, but the meals are overpriced and don't taste very good.",0
"Hidden gem of C-U. Free parking in parking garage next door.\n\nBurgers, Beer, Fries. Top 5 burgers.",0
Was looking for a noodle place in phoenix and found Cherryblossom. It was fantastic! Definitely the place to go for ramen and udon. Hidden gem.,0
"Went for lunch. Food tasted fine. Portions were small and WAY overpriced. Terrible service...servers were inattentive and indifferent, the manager bordered on rude. Will never return.",0
So good...feels like your in Hawaii n food is amazing,0
Great healthy fast food and really happy with music in dining room and the beautiful service people working here at the border,0
We found this place from a recommendation from a friend. It is a gem and we love the outdoor patio. \nGreat skinny margarita and excellent poblano enchilada\nNo overly priced and great service,0
Awesome pizza! Music was so cool too! Great for all ages! He accepts requests to plus birthday announcements!  Accepts only $ or checks!,0
Awsome had the beef fried rice so good worth a shot,0
Had a good little breakfast for under $6.00. Simple decor friendly staff.,0
Definately don't treat their employees well. Two thumbs down!,0
Good stuff! They fixed my shoes within 24 hrs and came out looking like new for $15,0
"No Hay! Very nice guys there. They pointed me in the direction of Mesa Feed, even gave me the address.",0
"Like a poor mans version of Sweet Tomatoes. Less choices and less flavor. It's pretty disappointing. Spend the extra couple bucks and drive down the street to a better salad bar, or go to a real restaurant",0
We went in for some breakfast after a late night. Waited for ten minutes for anyone to talk to us. Walked around the corner to find the waitress asleep. Take a nap before you come to work!,0
"The corn cakes and the bacon wrapped prawns. I would sell my mother for them. Does that make me a bad person? Or just really, really hungry?",0
"I love this place, but the prices are a little higher than other breakfast places. The atmosphere is really nice.",0
"This place was cute and clean and had nice personality, but when it came to the food it was very ordinary. These are dishes you can throw together yourself if you wanted. Nothing spectacular at all, I wouldn't come back to this place.",0
"Just A-OK, long walkway between terminals.",0
Very disappointed.  Entire cake went to waste and was not enjoyable.  Party spoiler.,0
Great place for Sunday brunch. Blood Mary's very good.,0
"$3.00 fresh baked Italian loaf, need I say more.  The Italian bread is so yummy and makes great bruschetta.  They bake their bread fresh daily and do not include any preservative so eat it quick!",0
"The owner is an ignorant egotist. Talks down to customers and is amazingly rude. I wont be going back, even with really low prices, I don't like being treated rudely.",0
"I come here ever time I get my oil changed across the street. They are always very nice. The food is good, and prices aren't bad.",0
For some reason I always have to connect between terminal E and terminal A. As a hub it's pretty busy so hoof it to your next gate!,0

"Dive Bar Nuff Said! No AC, just swamp cooler. Uhhhh Stuffed animal claw machine is full of Pornos??? Alrighty then!",0
Why have this restaurant listed? IT HAS CLOSED DOWN!!!,0
"Great store. Staff is professional and friendly.  Only downfall, during the summer,  upon entering the store, it smells funky. I cannot describe the smell, just I recommend they clean their A/C ducts??",0
Inedible General Tso chicken. I will never go back here.,0
"Everything is great except for the fried wings. The wings are very bland and have no flavor. The BBQ WAS Incredible, the beans, mashed potatoes, gravy, and oh the onion strings are incredible.",0
Cheap good food.  You will leave with your side busted out.  One of my favorite dives when I visit Vegas.\n\nSkip the Pink Taco and try this place.  The refried beans are to die for.,0
It's a grocery store! A decent one at that. Need I say more?,0
"I got a chicken pita with fries, and the food was so bland, even with the sauce. The fries also had no salt or anything on them, and the only flavor was the ketchup. Bland food, disappointing lunch.",0
My favorite mexican food restaurant. Best salsa! Tortilla soup is so so good. Mini beef tacos with cheese!,0

"Great food!!!!!! Ate here for dimsum, the chicken feet are soo good, so delicious. the sauce is very good and they also have other varieties of food as well. will definitely come back again for dimsum",0

"I have never seen one of the Dr's. here, but I have always gotten excellent care from their awesome PA's. I will certainly be back as it was easy to get in and get an appointment.",0
Check them out on Ch 5's Dirty Dining 11/7/13. You be the judge.,0
"This hotel has so much potential and looks like it was. Staff very nice, furnishings and decor very nice but you can see the building and mechanicals crumble in front of you.",0
Meh. Not that great. I got the sesame chicken lunch combo and totally regret it. The egg roll tasted like it was previously frozen & lacked flavor. The chicken was way too salty and the rice was edible but nothing special.,0
The food is very good. The service is TERRIBLE. We waited 20 minutes on a refill and another 20 for our check. Our waitress was rude. If the service was better I would come back. Unfortunately it's not.,0
Good place for eating before a Cardinals game.  Ribs are somewhat over cooked and a little dry. Cajun sauce is good. order it on the side.\nBrisket is great and moist.,0
"This is a fun shoe store in a great neighborhood. Prices are reasonable. The selection is great, but they were out of my size in several shoes that I wanted to try. Service was average.",0
Pretty good deals for happy hour.  The bar looks real busy with tvs and tall tables.  Beer's are a little too pricey for it being in Peoria Arizona.,0
We went and the service was slow and our food was wrong.  I won't go back.,0
Be sure to really check your order before leaving the drive thru.  Always mess up my order.,0
Wednesday's is bike night.  And also wet t-shirt contests start at 10 if you're into that apalling nonsense.  Drink prices were good.  $11 for a bucket of Coors Lights.,0
Great soup and Shrimp caprice. The only reason why I go there.,0
My friend and I made an appointment and still waited 15 minutes after we arrived. 2 of the women were rude and one even said my friend asked for the scrub when she didn't and still charged the extra money for it. Never going back!,0
"This is the best pizza I have ever tasted.  I get the cheese bread, pizza and cheese ravioli and all of it is excellent.  I also tried the apple/cinnamon dessert which also was outstanding.  Highly recommend it",0
The steak rolls are good but not worth the price,0
I really felt like I was in Vegas when i got off the plane and saw  MANY SLOT MACHINES in the airport!!,0
I brought in a bunch of dress shirts and suit pants for same day service.  They had them ready by 5 pm and didn't use too much starch.  I'd definitely use them again.,0
"Just came across a stash of Rehab drinks! Don't get too excited, i got all they had - 9 cans :D\nNice employees, had whipped cream which I also needed.  This is a good corner store.",0
Rough start for lunch. Waitress with an attitude.,0

"made my connection without fuss, and had a beer at a place I can't remember the name of, but it was a local brewery I think.  Good beer.",0
"Fast, cheap and fresh.  You will find most Chinese staples at this joint.",0
Pho ga chicken was dried out. The spring rolls were the smallest portion I've ever seen & the peanut sauce was watered down. I've tried eating here twice. I give up,0
The chicken shwarma is awesome!   The fries are hand cut and really good. Service is quick and the prices are reasonable. May have found my new lunch spot!,0
It's like Mexican food without being super greasy. Else everything is good here. Service is good as well.  Wish this place was bigger that's all.,0
"This place allows dogs! Free of charge! Beyond that it was the standard airport hotel. Price was decent, used Hotels.com for this place.",0
"People here are so mean especially the workers, when me and my boyfriend came here they were making fun of us cos we' re gay. I would never ever come back here anymore.",0
My favorite Vietnamese/pho place!  Wouldn't ever replace it!  Their customer service is about the same as any other Asian place lol but they're fast and I'm all about food quality it's a A+ to me!,0
This is a really nice fry's. Their bakery is actually better than most of their other locations.,0
"I love their cranberry, apple & grilled chicken salad. The lettuce is fresh and the blue cheese does not taste cheap. The restaurant itself is clean and well furnished.",0
Say it with me now: Blaaaaaaaaaand.,0
"Nice, clean local place in Green Tree. Might be a little pricey but the food is good and homemade.",0
"I love this restaurant, food is delicious. I love bringing fam here when they visit. Very delicious food",0
Ordered Pad Thai with level 4 spiciness. It is not that spicy but I think it is a bit too oily for me. Pad Thai from Thai Caf\u00e9 is much better.,0
I ate it and I didn't die. I'm so happy to say these words. What more can you say about greasy rice and cogulated 'brown' sauce?,0
How many times do I have to get crappy blueberries from Sprouts before I learn my lesson?,0
Unfortunately My Cousin Vinny has closed- the sign on the front states it is going to be a church (not kidding). Remodeling going on.,0
Food was good. Nice setting. A bit pricey.,0
"Grade: C-\n\nGood food except you have to order it at the \""food counter\"" and bring it to yourself. Very lame concept.",0
Service is awful. Waited over 25 minutes just to have our order taken. There were tables who were seated after us whose orders were taken before us. We were getting ready to walk out when the waitress finally came over. Never again.,0
Really good if you aren't watching your weight.  I like the sour cream dip with chips.  Sopapillas are really yummy as well.,0
Speedy quick delivery. Able to order completely on the iPad. Good Chinese comfort food for a sick patient in the hospital.,0
"This was a great dining experience!  I enjoyed everything about this restaurant.  Very nice outdoor seating in a quiet location, great food and good service.  Can't wait to go back!",0
"This place is amazing: the architecture is modern and the sound the best I know. For classical music lovers, a \""must\"" in Phoenix, AZ. Not sure what offers other program than the classic.",0
Long waits and teenage workers with bad attitudes...nuff' said.,0
"Ah, another high school pit stop. This place is great for random gifts, humorous books and furnishings. Keep an eye out for their clearance items, great discounts.",0
Easy-flow airport - in and out. Houston needs to take lessons!,0
Pretty good sandwiches. Large sandwiches. \nWould say earl of sandwiches is better. \nCheese steak tastes similar to philly. Capastrami is good,0
I love this airport. I only fly using jet blue so it is very easy to get in and out of. There is always taxis and car service ready to pick you up if you havent made prior arrangements.,0
I now know what you get when you pray to baby Jesus... these ribs. SO GOOD!!!!!!!,0
"A classic. You can't go wrong with anything. It's just good, greasy food at its best!",0
Their broth is pretty good here. Taste really fresh,0

Never again. Waited this morning 30min and just now 40 min when originally told it would take 5 min.,0
"I didn't expect to see Chumlee or anything but did expect some cool antiques. I did not see any cool antiques. Kinda depressing overall, as was Vegas in general.",0
"Pretty Ok food. I ordered Kung Pao chicken, it really didnt have that much chicken but it had a great flavor. Also order Egg fried rice and that was good too.",0
"Half-ass dim sum, theres better places in town. Service is poor, unless you were a rolex watch like most of the waitresses do!",0
Maintaince and maid service should be better.,0
"Used to go here quite often, but the food and atmosphere has changed dramatically. The portions are very small for the price. Had a small salad and a muffin and it was over $10! Will not be coming back.",0
The staff was very friendly and professional.  The grounds were kept very clean.  The National Memorial Cemetery put on a very good memorial service for my Uncle.,0
"I got recruited out of this mall for the Army back in 2005. They have since moved the recruiter station down the street, because it was \""unsafe\"" to be in this mall. That should tell you something about coming here.",0
I asked for no onions and pickles but I might as well have asked for a punch in the mouth because I got neither.,0
"After hearing how great Jimmy John's is, I decided to go in myself and see what all the fuss was about. To be honest the sandwich wasn't good. I gave them 2 stars for having good customer service and for being so quick.",0
"Not the best beers I have ever had, but always a solid place to go off Mill.   I love the upstairs patio.  Their salads and apps are good, I was not a fan of the tacos.",0
"This place is great!  My husband and I eat a lot of fresh fruits and veggies which can be very pricey. I found this amazing market, very clean great produce and affordable Cheek it out!",0
Worth checking out.  The food was good and the scene is relaxed.,0
"Very awesome place for bread. Very good. Go in early though because it will sell out :,(",0
"Nice clean rooms and the price was right.  Nothing fancy like the strip hotels, but it was not a dive either.",0
Long wait ok service good thing they have the ultimate feast otherwise I would never come:,0
Jonathan in Tire Center is excellent.  Get there when they open 10am or expect to need a friend for a lift.,0
"Hummus was just great. I've trident their \""special\"" Greek wine and honestly didn't like it. Briefly - he'll of food worth the money.",0
This is where I am going from now on to get tires. It was fast cheap and the service was good. Plus they have a great deal on covering your tires. Way better than big o tires,0
"This is a State Steet type of bar that is not on state.  Cheap tap beers, typical bar food.  It may be time for an update and some new menu items.....",0
"Old Country Buffet is above average as far as American buffets go. If you're in the mood for it, it's pretty tasty.",0
Dining room is a little dingy for a chain. Ripped seat cushions and a messy condiment bar. Drive through does not get orders exact (e.g. Ask to hold the cheese ensures a hamburger with cheese).,0
"Quick friendly service.  These guys actually want you to get the cheapest price with the best coverage.  Imagine that, from an insurance person?",0
Not recommended. Szechuan beef tasted like ketchup. Spring roll spongy and tasted bad. Pork fried rice is OK.  My daughter likes the Sesame Chicken but too sweet for my taste.,0
"Dirty bathroom, NO plugs for my MacBook that fit. All floor plugs have a metal frame that blocks my charger. Chairs have no plug. Terminals are separated too far so they can fit slots",0
"HUGE nachos, great comfort food, and chill atmosphere.  Chicken and Dumplins!  There is another location in Huntersville, but isn't always quite as good.",0

Had escargot for the first time.. Interesting not sure ill ever try that again but the salmon was good,0
I walk by this place constantly. It's a diet of the mind not to run in and get an old fashioned each and every time.,0
"Poor service mediocre food. NY NJ native we appreciate Chicago food, this was very poor imitation of Italian food.",0
This place is fantastic. they have a restaurant inside the grocery store. very good food.,0
Worst food I've had this year! Even for a bar / restaurant I would expect more. Greasy tasteless stale food.,0
BOTTOM LINE: I love the soup & sandwiches. I can bring my dog.,0
"Its alright, I think they are better then Sweet Tomatoes. They offer more variety then Sweet tomatoes and they are cheaper. You get a coupon for Souper salad, then i would go here.",0
"Easy. Nothing AMAZING, nothing AWFUL.  Just solid all around. If you want to keep grocery shopping easy, this is your spot.",0
"Always fast, always get exactly what I order, no need to go anywhere else.",0
Best Chinese food ever! And the staff is super nice as well :),0
"Always tasty takeout, and they make my chicken and broccoli to order.",0
I found comfort and refuge here while living in las vegas.  I thought the food was good and the prices were reasonable for the quality.  Not far from the strip.,0
"Recently rented a car from Enterprise and had great service.  The car was ready, clean and the staff was great!",0
I went there for a Deaf EXPO. This place is so huge and beautiful. It is in the right location because the bar/restaurants are nearby. The parking garage is across the street. I enjoyed this visit very much.,0
I had both of my card spray painted and they worked with my insurance to fix both cars with no cost to me. It took a little longer than I would've liked but they did good work.,0
Nothing special. Nothing stood out as great or super fantastic.,0
Took forever to get a salad. We think he forgot. Our chicken parmesan arrived obviously microwaved. Food was indelible. We did not see a manager to express our displeasure.,0
"Michelle took care of my elbow. She's cool. Never went to a chiropractor before, so I can't compare to other places. So far so good",0
"Coming from New Mexico, Mexican food is in my DNA. I have tried many things here but I come for one thing and that is the bean and cheese burrito! Tastes like it came from my mothers kitchen!",0
"Hotel is clean but extremely dated. This particular Sheraton is in major need of a refresh. Carpet is worn, wallpaper coming off the walls and bathrooms with minimal lighting. This place is not up to the Sheraton's usual standards.",0
"Slots + clean bathrooms, what more could you ask from an airport? Perhaps slots in the bathrooms, now thats an idea.",0
Went there again the other night. Looking more and more rundown and the floor was filthy.,0
"Not good at all! You get a cheap patty, hard bread, and the time it took was crazy long should have went to Wendy's or something",0
Food was really good! The tenderloin ala Blue was so good with their risotto. DO NOT Valet your car though. Took us 45 min to get it back.,0
Great place for brunch with friends. Food is good and well worth dropping in.,0
"I have been going to Los Olivos for more years than I care to remember.  They still have the best Mexican food in town, and you can't beat the salsa.",0
No reason to eat this with so many other choices in the area.,0
"Beer are good and the atmosphere is excellent, a must see as it's in an old church converted into restaurant & brewery. I was not impressed with the food. The French onion soup was too salty, although the fries were pretty good.",0
"Got the creamy pesto penne pasta i added some shrimp,  absolutely delicious.",0
"Decent place, stopped by for dinner for a friends birthday.  \n\nFood was good, but the real winner here is the service!",0
"Worst place ever. Don't go there. Customer service was awful and they didn't even do what I asked them to, due to them trying to scam me for more business. I will never go back.",0
"Definately not service with a smile. Order is usually wrong, and workers are rude.",0
"The bathtub in our room was full of water, hair and dirt when we arrived.  If you are looking for a clean room, this is definitely not the hotel for you.",0
"The people are friendly and took great care of my \""boys\"".  I also use their grooming services and am very happy with the results.",0
"Rude people work for this airline and the planes are old and seats really tight. One of the worst in the US. In line with other awful airlines like united or American. If u can, fly virgin",0
"A pretty decent mall, a few too many empty stores of late though.  The food court is okay.  The carousel is real cool looking.",0
"Cool staff, nice selection. They had lots of pre used and old systems. If you haven't been to a game stop you need to go. Rewards  program is legit.",0
We go here because my husband can use the free wi-fi. We like the friendly people that work here as well.\nDebbie H,0
"Took things in to sell today. Not only do they pay next to nothing for hardly used items, the owner was so surly and condescending, I wish I'd given my stuff to Goodwill which I will do in the future.",0
Terrible selection and the employees don't know jack about what they sell. Also it's just about as overpriced as it can get. Just go to dick blik or arron brothers. Just anywhere but here.,0
"Terribly disappointing! The hamburger from the one undaring person was the best thing in the menu. If you want want true, good authentic German food, look elsewhere.",0
I got house chips with my sandwich. I thought house chips are cooked in restaurant. I received store bought ruffle chips in a plastic sandwich bag. Lol,0
Went for lunch and was very disappointed. Restaurant smells musty and the food was awful. Service was very good.,0
Nice view.... Nobody here.... And service is not that great. Have to wait for drinks.  Food service slow as well. VERY average.,0
If I could give a negative 5 this would be it they could not make fries could not make sundaes got the total wrong gave the wrong change shorting me $5.00 could not provide a receipt DO NOT come here,0
Shocked this place has 4 stars. First off you can always tell if a Mexican food place is good based on the beans and the salsa. Well guess what both suck! Eat at el molino's and you will never come here again!,0
"Vartan what can you say about him that hasn't been said. A true gentleman, a humble man, a generous man... hospitality is A++++ at Ambassador. Make time to burn",0
I was impressed they had very fresh salads and toppings. Also the baked goods and the chocolate mud cake were on point.,0
"This place just bored me.\nReally don't know what to say.\nBored, bored, bored, bored, bored.",0
"This establishment has outgrown it's community, patients hidden in every nook & cranny.  Staff are knowledgable and friendly. The building it's self is extremely old and in need if repairs.",0
"We had excellent service, was very impressed with the organization our server showed. The food was wonderful, very fresh and cooked to perfection. Our Son loved it and said he will be going back with his friends.",0
Great haircuts time after time for a good price. Old school craftmanship. They have TV monitors all around the barber shop to watch while you wait. An excellent experience.,0
Love their food here. Great spot to go to after going out on a party. The service could be better tho!!,0
The bagels are good. The sandwiches leave something to be desired in the taste department and the coffee is over roasted. Everything is a bit over-priced for what you get. I have never had a problem with the customer service.,0
It's kinda nice having this Mexican joint in Sdale.\nVery good Sonoran Mexican and nice staff. I say joint because it looks like its been around for awhile; not a prettified corporate place.,0
Talk about a hole in the wall. No frills at all here. One page paper menu with only a handful of dishes on it. Worth it for the pho and the price can't be beat.,0
I have nothing but good things to say about this grocery & deli. The food is AMAZING. The service is GREAT! Wouldn't change a thing! I love going there!,0
"Absolutely the nicest folks here, the service is incredible. The food is always fresh and IMO very good. I've been going here for 5 years and the experience is consistently excellent",0
"Soooo disappointing! I've been to this one and one in Tucson, same story! Over priced buckets. The crab legs are thin and flimsy. My veggies and potatoes were over salted with chunks of sea salt!! Yuck!",0
good pizza and large wine list...  I like it since it is off the beaten path in Old Town...\n\ni agree that it is a nice group place... they also have a pretty nice outdoor area.,0
"Small menu, dining room closes at 7:30 pm not 8 pm. Drive thru is open till 8. Food is ok, you get your Greek craving.",0
"Sure miss our Rubios in Surprise but this is a nice treat near the movie theater on Deer Valley! Food is solid, staff was friendly, salsa was yum as always. Can always count on Rubios for consistent food.",0
"Most incredible pie if had, and everyone I went with thought so too. I had the banana cream pie and it was totally worth the money.",0
I had a lunch there once. The food is ok but it's on the pricy side. I don't think I will be back.,0
"One of my person favorite haunts, the employees are all friendly, the food is good and the beer is amazing. This place is always packed being right next to the college",0
Poor customer service was an understatement for this store.  The store was a ghost town but yet no representative even acknowledged my existence.  I will not return and will certainly alter my purchasing for my company's needs.,0
"Everytime i go to Vegas, I ALWAYS have to stop by here. \nI highly recommend The duck! \nIt is delicious! Other than that, i dont really recommend anything else.",0
"It's hit or miss. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not. I was very upset tonight when I ordered take out, the food was not good. Wont be going back!!",0
"Way too main stream and over-priced. Coffee is not as good as what would be found at a local shop where the employees actually care. Employees were rude and slow, even when there were not many customers waiting.",0
Awesome custard!!! The best in Las Vegas. Make sure to bring cash. They do not take debt or credit cards.,0
Asked for spicy Teryaki chicken and receive a pile of burnt red peppers on top. Whole dish tasted like burnt food. Bummer. Owners seemed nice.,0
"I've tried this place a few times, that was my last time. The food is not good to me.",0
I just moved back to Charlotte and I am elated that Tommy's is still a fixture in the area :) So many great memories & I look forward to hanging out!!,0
"Great place for bald guys to go. Horrible location, employees can barely speak English, and they have no talent to cut hair at all. Going to be wearing this horror show around for quite a few weeks.",0
"This place has shockingly expensive drinks for an establishment that looks divey. That's why no one ever goes here. I'm not sure how they stay in business, but God bless them.",0
I use to go there in very regular base. I love their tomatoo soup. IT IS A MUST. I also like their  chicken palte with white sauce (I think mushroom). The owners are lovely and sweetheart,0
Have a great happy hour. Good food and beer. Enjoyed myself. Great stop for sushi. Try it out if you get a chance.,0
The food came out tasting dry and a little old.. I was not too impressed but I have had some pretty good Mongolian grill before this was kind of like the McDonald's version of YCs taste wise.,0
I've only been for lunch and everything is drenched in red sauce.  I really didn't care for it.,0
"If you do nothing else, you must enter RH and get swept away in bliss and beauty.",0
HOW SAD! If you yelpers don't give Mcdonalds 5 stars you are on crack this place is Gods gift to the world! Long live the Big Mac!,0
Enjoyed breakfast this morning and our waitress Cece was the best.  Definitely recommend this place.,0
"Lamb was tough, chicken was dry, the sauces were too oily.  Decently flavored sauces and the soup was very nice, but I won't be back.",0
The only thing this place has is free Wifi.  The food prices are horrible!  Baggage is slow.   Slot machines take up much seating. Kiosk salesman soliciting passengers.,0
First time I have been to church in years.....Was as cool as it gets for church.,0
"The breakfast (ham & cheese omelet) was the best, but the service was not the best. The toast was cold, my wifes blueberry pancake wad terrible.",0
Are u kidding me $53 for a mediocre meal!!!!! That was nothing short of robbery. Dot get me wrong the interior design was great I just wish the food was good also!!!!!!!!!,0
"Only come here for my automotive needs.  Quick, professional, honest service everytime!",0
"Great food, excellent service, this will become a regular of ours!",0
Smokey and old but for under $2.00 you get a good breakfast and in my opinion the food quality is what you would find at Denny's or Ihop,0
We eat there alot and we have never had a bad meal. It is recommended to call ahead to place your order.,0
The food wasn't very good and neither was the service. Also the Groupon gave us a limit of $17.95 per entree and the most expensive thing was only $9. We won't be going back.,0
Ate here all the time at u of Pitt. Love it. Better than philly cheesesteaks and I lived near Philly for a few years. Don't walk run to uncle Sam's.,0
"I ordered my glasses, they called me when they arrived, and I went to pick them up.\nThe staff was friendly and answered all my questions.",0
"resort? not really, this an old hotel with very thin walls. rooms are outdated. this was my first and last stay at this place.",0
Everyone is right. This airline also sucks. Mostly because every time I fly US Airways I experience:\n\na) Check-in lines out the door\nb) Airplanes from the Nixon administration era.,0
Still waiting for business to honor their commitment and return B. Makousky designer purse lost or replace with check,0
"good cheap filling meal big ass portions, don't eat before a pool party or you'll be trying to hold your gut in.",0
"Food is awful and so greasy. Service was good, but food is bleh. Go to Doan's instead.",0
"Are you kidding me? I've enjoyed frozen dinners better than Applebee's. Oh, but Applebee's is frozen food, right? When you are familiar with fresh food, this is not for you.",0
"We have been taking our shoes for repair here for so many years. He's amazing and a very friendly man too, I recommend Cecil hands down!",0
When I called I started talking and she said hold and put me on hold about 5 mins later she finally got back on and was very rude.\n\nWill not send people there!!!!,0
"It appears Grandma's has moved to the SW corner of Country Club and Main St., in Mesa.  We will see if the space is as noisy now.  I wish them luck.",0
Really good deep fried fish that is breaded on the spot. Tastes fresh. Potato salad is very good.,0
A little overpriced but the bagels are always good and fresh. The cinnamon French toast (made from their cinnamon log bread) is also very good!,0
"This is my favorite hole in the wall neighborhood bar.  Whether I wear my suit and tie, or a T-shirt, I always feel comfortable here!  The drinks are cheap and strong, and the bartenters are nice too.",0
"Depending on the time, claim a seat/table before you get in line. If you wait you may be sitting outside. It's a popular hangout.",0
Wish I could leave no stars waited 25 minutes for waitress Cindy to take our orders. Never happened? She Helped everyone beside our table. Rude service never returning.,0

Average to below average sonic. Slower than most.,0
Great service great price!!! They'll take any competitors coupon even if the deal is an amazing deal. I paid way less than I expected for my very worn out breaks.,0
"Don't waste your time or money.  The service is poor and the food is below average, nothing to write home about.  The restaurant is also very small.",0
Best-organized rubber stamp/craft store in the valley.,0
"The store is one of the best in the city. They have a terrific selection of organic and natural produce and meats. The staff is always super friendly from the stockers, to the checkers and all.",0
Somehow I manage to keep coming back for their $5.50 pound of chicken wings and pitcher of Wisconsin beer.,0
This is the best Chinese in campus-town.  Some dishes are not as good as others (such as eggplant and spinach).  I recommend the crispy tofu.,0
Overcrowded market. Nothing worth a crap. Overpriced with no real selection. \nDirty as well.,0
A little bit of renovation going on and things have been moved around but still a huge supply of goods.,0
"Best Chinese fast food I have found in the area.  Had Dragon Phoenix (1/2 shrimp with veggies and 1/2 general taos) --- plentiful, flavorful and fresh! New favorite take out place.",0
I'm new in town and also a hairstylist. Mallory did the best haircut that I've had in yrs.!!! Thank you and most certainly will be back!!,0
"Service at bakery checkout is terrible,  very rude and slow service.",0
The place has reopened under a new owner.  They have cleaned it up quite a bit.  Prices are good and I will be checking it out again.,0
Make sure you visit the bar and shoot spit wads at the girl behind the glass wall. funiest thing ever. great 20 something to 30 desparates on the scene. little young sometimes but still holds down a lively atmosphere.,0
This place is okay nothing really good to talk about.,0
"A little wait, a little slow, a little greasy, was just OK. Tough to do lunch here and get back to work on time.",0
DONT USE YOUR CREDIT/DEBIT CARD!\nBartenders will tip them self after you leave Even if you already tip them with cash!,0
Food Poisoning... enough said.    No more reheater places for me!  Well as long as the wife doesn't force me.,0
Good was not very good. The venue was so outdated the only good thing were the flour tortillas,0
"Service is sub par. Took 35 minutes to get a cheese pizza slice. Confused orders, and was late when the food did finally deliver. You could literally do better by microwaving ramen noodles.",0
Great guy hangout; waitresses are scantily-clad and friendly.,0
Better then McD and Bk. The Rally burger is kind of small the fries were good. Overall great alternative. Will try more options next time.,0
I bought a train set here for my son for Christmas.  He passed away due to cancer unable to use the train.  Roy's Train World would not take back the unopened train set.  Heartless.,0
I really enjoyed this place. The guy taking orders was awesome and the red Chile is great. Its very hard to find good red Chile and they have it.,0
"Good, not great food, friendly staff, overpriced. Had the burger with brisket, and Mac and cheese, and a beer. Everything was competent, just not worth the $22. tab.",0
"Love this store! Some of the cutest clothes, friendliest staff and best sales in town.  Only wish there was one in my home town of LA.",0
1 star is generous.  They literary had 3 cigars for sale.,0
Not the greatest tonight the quality is just a bit off.,0
The service is so slow it's ridiculous.  It can take 20-30 minutes for a cup.  It's an okay product but the service is unbearable.,0
"Nothing has changed, same boring food and same nonsense in the store area.",0
"This Dennys has great service, its open late, its clean and hardly crowded.",0
"Room 241 this time.  Octagonal room, very comfortable.  Nice.",0
Had booked reservation two days pior and Did not accommodate their mishap for not finding us in their reservation because someone didn't write it down and was unwilling to correct it. Made us wait when we had reservation. Manager glenn unwilling to help,0
These guys are not fair with price..they markup the parts too much and charge labor rates similar to dealerships. Took it elsewhere and saved 30%,0
"Wonderful mall! A nice blend of high end stores and regular priced stores. Parking can be annoying on the weekends so I'd recommend getting there close to opening or more towards closing if you need to go on a Saturday or Sunday,",0
"Mostly dudes\nnice theme, schoolgirls are nice\ncrap music.\nthe decor and theme are unique\nthe kinda place to go there once to say you've been, any more will drive you mad",0
This restaurant is the worst I've ever been. The hotel screed up my room and now this diner. Service is the worst and food is not far. The hotel deserve to be at the last hotel of the strip.,0
"Awful wings,  filthy tables. Good luck getting drink refills... and on a Monday night,  hate to be here on a busy night",0
I didn't even want to go. I was so wrong! Best place I ate in Vegas.,0
"A casual place to eat and drink in Tempe.  Lots of outdoor seating and is a great place to come with a group of peeps to eat, drink and be merry.",0
"Super clean and the food very tasty, i usually  dont go to this kind of restaurants,  but this one  is amazing, thanks  to Veronica and Savannah and the cooks of course",0
"Our family loves this place.  Friendly, well run and good with kids.",0
Adorable place! Historic building oozing with charm. Food was good and service was great! Full menu including vegan options. Win!,0
Service was poor.  Unfriendly atmosphere. Left before we could try food.  Very disappointed.,0
"The drinks were too weak, what is advertised as hot is not. We had the Shrimp Diablo which was bland (as were the home made tortilla). We were one drink and out..",0
Some of the best chow around--love this place. The bread and salads and soups are great.,0
"Food was great!  Service not so great...  When you're paying that much for a meal, the service should be just as good as the food.  Get the bananas foster for dessert, you won't be disappointed!",0
"The best Mexican food in Chandler.  Our church group started having taco nights here a few years ago, and they are so nice.  El Presidente Burrito is the best thing on the menu!!",0
"Clean theaters, above average sound and picture quality, fresh popcorn (3 of 3 times). \n\nWhat more can you ask for in a movie theater?",0
Summertime happy hour weeknights until 7:00PM- beer and margaritas under $3.00.,0
This place makes the Best Boba Tea in town. This is the only place my Japanese wife buys Boba Tea from.,0
"good finds, i found a tie that was 2.00 on sale looked brand new, i looked it up , it was going for $125.00 so you should go and just see what they have...",0
"Place looks closed, but really is open. Fast and friendly service. Very knowledgable. I recommend going there and yelping your experience.",0
"First time here was looking for food for a nursing bitch, the gentleman that helped me was extremely knowledgeable n helpful. Ill be coming back.",0
"I love Steve's Cafe. They serve lots of good food at a reasonable price. I've never had anything there that I didn't like, but right now, I'm especially into the Southwestern Chicken Wrap!",0
"Prices are okay. \nTheir bakery section is not good, so don't go there and expect to find a nice loaf of crusty bread. Plus the store feels dirty.",0
A quaint little neighborhood bar. Delicious sandwiches. Super nice northsiders. What more can you really ask for?,0
"Love the wings and fries! Sometimes it can get loud in there with all the drunks, but the service is always good!",0
"Not bad for a small restaurant on a golf course. My sandwich was done perfectly (Adobe melt), but I wasn't a big fan of the tiny fries. Service was below par though as one server was visibly annoyed by doing her job.",0
So tasty...the ranch is yummy! One day I will conquer the pizza challenge!,0
This place is no where near mexican food. Everything seems to be out of the freezer or a can. My entire experience at this restaurant was horrible.,0
"We eat here a couple of time a month, the food is always good and the service is good.  The lunch prices are great for a sit-down.",0
New digs are nice!  Service was solid.  Food was solid.,0
"Good entertainment because of the Showroom. Their food is alright and same with the bars. So, not too great, but not too bad neither.",0
"Always good and it has a very nice atmosphere, especially for the price. The steaks are good and you can't wrong with anything that comes with one of their croissants. Great service as well.",0
I was actually surprised with how good the service and Chinese chicken salad was at lunch. Far better than the CPKs back home in SoCal. Way to go Phx AZ!,0
I am positive no one who reviewed this place got water delivery. Worst customer service ever! Every month there was s new issue and no one knows what end is up when you call. Horrible.,0
Woefully understaffed.  One bartender and one server for the whole restaurant. \nLeft hungry and thirsty.,0
"Absolutely beautiful decor.  Tasteful, interesting, makes you feel as though you've escaped the desert.\n\nSpring rolls were tasty, salad was intense but delicious in its way.",0
Best Mexican food I've found in this town so far. Great chips and salsa bar. Bean dip was good. Had the appetizer sampler. Everything was good. Just wish it was open for lunch.,0
Breakfast is ok.  Lunch and dinner are horrible.  The food is bland in some cases and plain awful in other cases.   The Stratosphere does a lot of things well.  The Buffett isn't one of them.,0
"This location is great! There are never lines and the staff is always friendly. I did have an issue once, but the staff was super helpful in resolving it. It is WAY better than the extremely busy post office around the corner.",0
C concourse has no internet signal.  Anyone interested in a hot dog eating contest at Nathan's? No waiting.,0
"Slowest service ever, sitting in drive through for ten minutes now :(\n\nNot very good, drink was watery...",0
"First, this is my favorites Sub Factory location. It's the only one with the seafood sub. As a whole I'm not a huge fan of the chain, the food is low quality, bland, and unoriginal.",0
not worth the money \nthe food and service is awful,0
"Like anywhere in this city, it is a chore to drive there.  Parking was next to impossible and after that the place is CLOSED",0
"Old, dirty and disorganized!  The security lines and baggage claim areas are horribly overcrowded.  Service is slow.  Tear it down and start over!",0
"Good service, smiling faces, and the best food Denny's has to offer. Unlike most Denny's I have been to, I don't think anyone is on parole here.",0
A great family business. They are a pleasure to work with and very good at problem solving.,0
Overpriced and overbearing...food was plain.,0
I don't have anything bad to say.  Everything was great from the amazing food to the fantastic service.,0
This restaurant has decent tasting food. I like their tacos because they melt their cheese onto the tortilla before putting on all the topping :) really enjoy that. Other than that just like any other taco shop. Not bad. I liked it.,0
"This is the place where good UW boyfriends take their girlfriends for nice dates, anniversaries and the like. For a sloppy college student, it's a chance to dress up and enjoy the quiet, dim ambience and great Italian cuisine.",0
"Fun. A regular spot for early dinner with friend. Not a great diversity in seafood selections, but it is a crab place",0
"Room was very small, smelled dirty, bath tub drained extremely slow. I will never stay here again. Light fixtures were rusting and room is outdated. Don't expect any type of luxury here. You get what you pay for.",0
The renovation makes this location one of the nicest in town... Perfect timing for the Publix opening next door.,0
I love this place. I have been coming here since I was pregnant with my son on 2011. Dr.Glassman is a great doctor. I never have had issues with the staff before.,0
"Came here for the flashlight tour which was very interesting, could have had some more wildlife out for people to see but very cool.  Don't come here during the middle of the day it's HOT!",0
Food was great once we got it. Cooks missed up/ skipped our ticket so it took more time to get our food. Server was nice.,0
The worst gate connections on southwest flights.  We had 10 minutes to go across the airport and almost misses our flight. They need to do a better job of getting people to the correct gates.,0
Had the special 2 slices and med drink under $5. Great deal great pizza!!,0
Everything was delicious. We had the 25 wing sampler platter and could only eat 18 because the wings were so big. Waitress was nice and very helpful. Would recommend for wings over all others.,0
Had to come get my free birthday burger with my family. I had the Whiskey River BBQ burger. It was a nice size and the fries were good as usual.and we had good prompt service even though they were really busy that day.,0
The nail polish chips off less than a day! They don't massage your hands like they do other salon's. Not worth the money.,0
My kids love going to the dentist! They remind me when it been 6mo. We love Dr. Quackenbush and his staff!!!,0
i thought it was good and it's cheap mexican. just dont expect anything fancy-don't know that i would actually eat inside.,0
Nice hotel/rooms. Food all around the area. $15/day for internet is a joke!,0
Went back and the food is good and the pricing is decent.  Oscar is a great cook and made up for the groupon incident,0
Great old-school donut shop with delicious donuts.  The even still tie up the boxes.,0
"I never get food here, I always just get drinks. Never had a problem with service or waits. Can't comment on food though.",0
Dinner with friends on valentines day - food pricing absurd - service lousy. Many better choices.,0
"Had a great dinner there tonight. Clean, friendly, great deal on delicious food. Good sized portions for a great price. We will definitely go back soon.",0
"Went through the drive thru to get some coffee and water today. It was a rather long wait, but when we finally got to the window they gave us our drinks for FREE! Such a nice and pleasant surprise. Thanks Starbucks!",0
Came here to buy a business pad and some thank you cards. I found everything quite easily and everything was reasonably priced. Not a bad place to get those things you don't want in bulk. Friendly staff.,0
"Nice try, but nothing memorable or worth going back for.",0
"Just a cute place with pretty good food! I loved sitting outside and watchng the great cars and bikes in Cave Creek. Harolds is a greasy spoon kind of a place, but that's part of the fun of it!",0
Shrimp few in shrimp low mein and was not very tasty. Disappointing.,0
Went here for the first time and had breakfast. The hashbrowns and pancakes were awesome. Can't wait to go back for lunch sometime.,0
Really good lentil soup.  Great rice.  Lamb combo was ok but everything else was pretty good!,0
pouched eggs are totally raw eggs. Long long waiting time for breakfast after beverages. Served obviously rotten strawberry.,0
Great executive course right in the heart of Scottsdale. The 18 th hole gets me every time. There are discounts online at golfnow.com. The course is always in great shape and their driving range is good.,0
Terribly slow service (especially drive through) and they're always running out of things.,0
"Not nearly as good as the one on Boulder Hwy. Ordered a simple Bacon and Eggs and the bacon was to salty, the eggs were cold, and the toast was nearly burned. The potatoes were good and the price was great.",0
Worth a stop but not a return.  2 1/2 stars.,0
"I love this place beyond words.  They have a good selection of vegan food, and their fake meat is awesome.The soynamis and oatmeal cookies are amazing.  Can't recommend it enough.",0
"The service is fast and friendly. Good size portions. Each time i have had their food i have enjoyed everything. Its not the best Chinese food if all time, but its good food for a good price.",0
"North Tower a bit run down. Clogged sink, mold growth on the ceiling, non smoking room smells of smoke, bed shows obvious signs of wear. Needs updates ASAP.  Will not stay here again till repairs are made.",0
The donuts were fresh and delicious. The apple fritter was perfectly cooked. The cake donuts were a magical blend of crispy and moist. My kids approved of the chocolate frosting.,0
Mediocre mexican food! Delicious but not outstanding. Crispy taquitos. Fresh tamales. And crunchy chimichangas! Try their Baja dip!,0
"Terrible Staff...Cashier chewed gum, talked on cell and asked that I excuse her behavior because it was close to closing.",0
Not impressed at all!\nSunk in mattress and no refrigerator in a King Deluxe room.\nNice grounds,0
DJ Tsunami.... Mixes music like a train wreck. The beats are off he either ends a song then starts up another or he completely destroys the mix. I don't know where they got him but he needs to go back.,0
The orange chicken is great. This place is always packed.,0
Good ice cream but great environment!  Very cute.,0
Helllooo salespeople!  Enough with the attitude.  \nDon't forget...I'm shopping. You're working.,0
"What you expect out of a 24 hour diner.  Food can be pretty good, service can be pretty bad.",0
"Let me get to the point. This steak house is ok. We have other steak houses in Charlotte. Chris, Morton, Capitol,  Frisco, Palm and Outback. If you're searching for a good steak?",0
Did the Thanksgiving buffet there.  Everything was fantastic,0
"This had to be one of the worst experiences we've ever had at this location. The server Nikki was awful, the food was mediocre at best. Never will we sit in her area again!",0
"It's like the minor league version of good steakhouses. Let's get serious...we all go there for the free bread. \n\nThe service here is solid, though.",0
"Not bad,  not great. Nice atmosphere with kind and professional staff. Food? Typical bar food, nothing spectacular at all. Great place for older folks.",0
"solid, quick, and cheap. long lines during lunch.",0
Did not enjoy my meal what so ever.The staff was cold and the seating area was dirty. The place was more of a hole in the wall then I can appreciate. Cheap but your getting what you pay for in quality.,0
Always perfect and fresh EVERY time!  I LOVE the Hong Kong Chicken.,0
"Had a drive for a fast food and decided to stop here. Nothing more, nothing else. Whopper was good. They have a new soda machine - fun to play with",0
I don't know what all the bad reviews are about. I eat lunch here once a week or so and like the food and service. Not bad at all!,0
I hate shopping at Walmart but it's one of the few places I can afford.,0
Good pizza.  Loved the sweet tomato sauce.,0
"My favorite grocery in the area. Staff is friendly; and they always have great deals. You can get sandwiches made to order too, which a lot of people don't realize!",0
The most low-rent taco bell i ever been to,0
"Pretty fun spot.  There is live music in the downstairs area, and a club in the upstairs area.  Good for groups with different tastes.",0
My waiter was awesome and my food was.delicious i.got.chicken fajita tacos. Mmmm love it,0
Great food! Good atmosphere! They also have a 24hr bar attached which serves the same food and has a happy hour.,0
"Food was very good.  BBQ pork yummy, good local beers and very good service.  Would come back again.",0
Always a good place to go with friends/family from out of town for it's vegetarian friendly menu.,0
We were looking for masks for a mascarade party and the girl at the front desk went out of her way to pull old ones from the back. Excellent customer service!,0
"This is the Pizza place i have searched for all my life, The new york style pizza just melts in your mouth. The perfect crust has been created at enzo's.\nyou must go here period..",0
Best toasted sammich I've ever had. I've tried a few different ones here but these days I just stick with what I know....the white widow! This place has a great vibe too!,0
"I had the Torta, it was decent, there was not a lot of meat on it.  If I come back I won't order the Torta again",0
"No matter which location I go to, I am never disappointed with Ruth's Chris.  I would live here if I could...  Feeling hungry?  Try the Porterhouse...AWESOME!",0
"Over priced, poor service, poor quality. This is a tourist trap and not worth your time.",0
"Typical \"" gas & go\"" Shell station. Very small island store/cashier station with a nice attendent believe it or not! Very conveniently located on the corner of Thomas and Hayden",0
"We ordered the buffet, the food was not very good and almost cold. The waiter we had did not say a word to us after taking our drink order, overall I'd say to avoid the buffet it, it was a waste of money.",0
This was decent for Chinese.  The service was great and the people were friendly.  However the food was run of the mill Chinese.,0
Bring your own ranch! They charge $1.00 for ranch. Food is OK but service SUX. E for effort.,0
The waitress told us we had to leave our table right after we paid our bill (and tipped her generously) just because we hadn't ordered another drink. I have never been treated so rudely by a waitstaff before in my life.,0
I think this will be my theater of choice.  There was just something cozy about it.  It has the same downfalls of all theaters~ expensive tickets and even more expensive snacks.  But it was clean and comfortable.,0
"This service really sucks. Reservations are not honored even if prepaid. Only highly \""upgraded\"" cars are available. \nAs I sit here four over an hour I know I will NEVER use hertz again.",0
"Solid Mexican food with good prices and friendly service.  The chips are flour rather than corn, which is unique, and theyre superfresh. Nice and LONG happy hour(s) 2PM-6PM everyday.",0
"After waiting for twenty minutes for our food, we asked how much longer and the waitress told us that others were there before us, so much longer, we would have to wait. Someone else will have to review the food, because we left.",0
This was a sweet little spot for great organic coffee.,0
"Okay, I came back and ordered the Beef Noodle Soup, and again I was disappointed.  The beef noodle soup was not tasty.  I will not be returning again.",0
"Overpriced, mediocre food and phony.  The wines are OK but somewhat pretentious.  If you want really good food and good wines, go up the street to Hillstone on Camelback.",0
OMG!!!! Best place EVER!!! I go there every year for my birthday. I love how many they options that they have. Also the dessert is AMAZING!!!!!,0
WIth an area that is lacking a nice place to go for lunch this place really hits the spot.  Service is great and food is excellent.,0
"Wings were good of course, but the kitchen could use some work. Too long of a wait for food.",0
This salon is very welcoming.  Krissy is an artist when it comes to cut and color.  She's also great to talk to.  I definitely recommend Beauty Worx!,0
I had to stop here just to pee and would never go in there again way to smokey.,0
Excellent restaurant. Ate here over 30 times. Highly recommend.,0
"Great place to have a beer, free breakfast, and watch a game.  I love going here and playing darts.  Staff knows me on a first name basis and remembers what I drink.. Kudos to a great local bar",0
the arizona center is to phoenix as the galleria is to scottsdale.  can you say white elephant?,0
Love this place! My favorite dish is their chicken fried rice! The owner here is super nice and the food here is delish!,0
Chips were good but crushed to little bits. Shrimp cocktail was terrible. Cilantro rice pretty good.,0
The faces change a bit more often than i'd like (not sure I've seen the same face more than twice) but fair prices and pretty good results have kept me coming back so long as I live close.,0
"This place is a sweet dive. I've never been here on a busy night, but I do know that its a good place to enjoy cheap drinks  and edible bar food after work.",0
We are so happy with GVAH!! We just moved here and we're nervous finding a good place to bring our pups. They did by disappoint!! So friendly and the prices cannot be beat!!,0
Please be careful here... They scratched my car and I thought the interior cleaning was poor. They seem to rush the car wash process. I'd look somewhere else.,0
BBQ was really dry and the tea was pretty stale tasting. Only part of the meal I enjoyed was the buttered biscuits. Cheap though.,0
Called up for take out and ordered a Sgt. Pepper.  Was told they no longer had peppers and onions so that sandwich was off the menu.  For that reason my rating went down to 2 stars.,0
it's in a bad location in Chandler. Long wait and the quality is not good. Place is dirty and stinky. Go to a different location.,0
"Considering the location, it's not too bad. Not the best Chinese food I've ever had but not horrible. It's somewhere in between Panda Express and real authentic Chinese food.",0
"Convenient, fast, and a good cut.",0
good bye chez nous..it was great while it lasted!!,0
"BBQ Mahi tacos were great!!  I loved our server, she was so friendly.",0
"I must say, this a wonderful and even fun place. Very interactive with lots to do. However,  expensive.",0
"Great for breakfast. Good biscuits and link sausages. Also I have not been disappointment with fish dishes, chicken.",0
I'm still waiting for my cab from last night.,0
Very good service. Had the chicken rotisserie and beef ribs. I loved the ribs more than the chicken.  A little pricey but excellent ambience.,0
"Great little space. Go see the Christopher Jagmin show right now!!! His colorful, slightly loopy encaustic paintings are a great reminder that life is fun, dammit, and art can be too!",0
Easy to get to and from where i need to go i travel to NY very frequently and staff are way cool,0
"constantly good, I have a favorite and they have never disappointed. Some times I have good servers something's bad it doesn't matter the food is alway great And I never leave hungry :)",0
"I've yet to play the course but I spend many Sundays on the driving range.  Beautiful view of downtown Phoenix.  Old school feel, lots of fun.",0
"I go here for the bulk nuts... almonds, cashews, and pecans in particular. Sometimes, they have irresistible prices on fruit and veggies. There is almost never a line at checkout. Parking is convenient.",0
"Slow service!  Crunchy pancakes?  What happened mimis? Used to be good.  They also recently changed their menu, with my favorite sandwich gone!  Never again.",0
3 stars for slot machines in the airport! Other than that it's just like any other airport.,0
Salon is hit or miss depending on who does your nails.  Last time that I went one nail wasn't even completely polished and the ends had not been filed smooth.  They are cheap but you get what you pay for.,0
They are never on time. I will wait an hour after my apt time just to see the vet. Ridiculous.,0
"DUBCHURCH Sunday nights, 'nuff said :)",0
"You get what you pay for here, its cheap but there is a reason.  Don't expect to be blown away, but for its price range its good.",0
no matter what time you go to a trader joes there is always a pretty decent line to check out.  Just wish that the store had 2 more check out stands.,0
"Great bar. Pizza is great, thin crust.  Best Pizza in town IMHO (not a big Papa Dels fan). Beer selection is so-so.",0
"I love this place. I like the classic ham sandwich. The food is yummy. You can buy sides when you don't cook. You get a stamp card for free food. Plus, they are always super nice.",0
Stopped going to this office since the atmosphere wasn't very modern and up to date. They said I needed work done but were going to charge $300 more than my new office. Glad I switched to another place.,0
"I love this place!\n\nIt's not fancy, it's a little corner diner but their coffee is very good.  Better than some of our local coffee shops even.  Their breakfast is much better t",0
My wife and I have always been happy with the food and service.  We have happily spent many a special occasion here.  We will continue to go back.,0
"Get your wallet ready, the prices are crazy high!",0
One of my favorites for breakfast or Brunch.,0
Haven't had burger King for years and they have hands down the best eggs for a fast food.,0
Think Panera Bread with more of a coffee shop feel.,0
This is a great pizza place!! The pizza is really fresh and tastes amazing! The price is really reasonable too!,0
"Best pizza in Las Vegas.   It's the only pizza that I've found to be comparable to New York Pizza.  Also the calzones are great and made to order, not pre-made and gross.",0
We got the party size and 2 slices of the Chicken pesto. All the food was great and filling. My kids were done after only a slice each.,0
"Food looked bomb but it wasn't even that good.. The Red Snapper Carpaccio wasn't fresh, I was really disappointed. I'd say Raku is way better.",0
"UNLV, what can I say?  Rebel through and through!  Rebels baby, all about Rebels.",0
"Great service, open late till 9pm. Good warranties.",0
"Seriously some of the best fusion food I've tasted.  Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese all mixed into one... Mmm mmm good!",0
It a nice place for pharmacy besides that please dont buy their earphones the 5 dollar ones suck just to let u know and save somo extra cash.,0
The food I was served was nasty.  I will not go back there.,0
Love this place! Especially because they are open until 3am.,0
"Small portions. Over priced food. Very small menu (dinner). Was OK, but disappointing overall.",0
Service was a little slow but great food and an interesting atmosphere.,0
"Cute restaurant, the food is good and the menu fresh. I thought it was a little pricey for lunch and the more masculine crowd might be put off by the shabby chic decor.",0
Average selection and service. I go because they carry liquid seaweed. Nothing special to report,0
"This school seems to overly teach to the test leaving overall student learning an afterthought.  Maybe this is just the way schools are now a days, but without a developed sports and arts program there are simply better options nearby.",0
"Technician had a speech prepared. Bait and switch, trying to sell unneeded repairs. Jerks.",0
"Just like another shoe place I reviewed, it's a hit or miss. This time it was a big miss. I found absolutely nothing.  Yuck",0
"Dry cleaned items came out great, but my laundered shirts were very wrinkled. \n\nCheap though for 6 items I paid 18 bucks.",0
One of the worst Wendy's I've ever experienced.  Every morning there was a 30-minute wait - after ordering - for food.,0
"The just fine egg would probably be a better name. Good potatoes, bad hollandaise. Good coffee. OK service.",0
Ordered delivery food took two hours and was cold. Wing sauce was spilled all over bag.,0
"I know this place is popular, due to the fact they are usually busy, and you MUST have an appointment! BUT, I find it to be just mediocre. Not impressed.",0
"Had work done to my Mitsubishi EclipseGT 07 for a duel exhaust system, with black tips. Pretty straight forward and simple with decent fair prices compared to other places.",0
Dive right in! It's my favorite dive in Urbana but since Gremer is gone it's not quite the same. Had to move westward to the other side of the tracks to see my favorite bartender.,0
"Ok pizza, rude staff.  Not a fan and won't return!",0
"I have lived here for a year and a half and have only had a handful of issues. The size of the apartments are nice, the landscape is beautiful, and the people are generally friendly. I love the office staff!",0
The lady who runs the office is unpleasant and rude. Will not use this garage in the future.,0
Accepts student I'd's! 7 dollars instead of 10:),0
"The doctor himself is rather \""blah.\""  It's the office staff that makes this place so awful.",0
"Not the best sports bar but nice patio. TVs too small for the size of the place. Avoid Sunday football, not well set up for breakfast or coffee.",0
Friday night all you can eat fish fry....ask for it grilled if you prefer!  Be sure to leave room for the homemade pies.  Chicken pot pie is a must try as well!,0
"Horrible food. My bun was hard and the onion rings tasted like old grease. They forgot my husband's french fries and of course, we didn't realize it until we were down the road. Will not return.",0
Great pizza fresh ingredients.   The pineapple is the best pineapple ever.  Home made salad dressings.  Never disappointed!,0
I stopped coming to this location because they NEVER give you napkins in the drive-thru..employees here are pretty grumpy.,0
"We went there with a small group of friends for Arizona's Restaurant Week & Loved it! The food, service & prices were Great.",0
"For the price, you can't beat Mi Patio. Grab a pitcher of margaritas with a friend and munch on their amazing chips and salsa while you wait for 2 chicken tacos with rice and beans.",0
"Do not go here.   Misdirection, Misdiagnosis, Miscommunication.  Result: Our sweet dog died the next day.",0
"Barfood, greasy burger soggy fries, not the worst but nothing to back for.",0
Ok subs I'd rather have a hot sub fire house.,0
"Banana toasted coconut pancake are pretty much the only reason to get out of bed on Sunday. Add to this the fact that Merchant doesn't have a Sunday brunch, this really is the only reason to be on that block.",0
Great office! The office consists of very dedicated staff members that love their job-and it shows. Both dentists on board take great care of their patients. they take the time to know the individual and tailors to each persons needs.,0
I've tried several of their dishes. It's ok.  I did like their cocktail de camaron but nothing special.,0
I've been coming to Kolbys for the past 25 years... Still the same great service and delicious food!,0
"The Harmony hours listed are dead wrong and they are open, not closed. Makes me wonder about the fact-checkers at yelp... do they have any?",0
Good food. Worst dining experience ever. The waiter was extremely rude. Will never go here again.,0
I have just had one of the BEST meals of my life. We ate at L'Etoile Restaurant in Madison. And not just that the food was great... the service and attention to detail was remarkable. WOW.,0
I thought the location move would help this pizza hut.  I was wrong it takes an hour and 30 min to get food and its cold. How does it stay open?,0
"Love Caps, and this location is clean and fast. I think people forget it's here, so I've never seen it too crowded.",0
Overpriced and dirty. Never had any good memories from this place.,0
They have some awesome bartenders. You'll always get your drink fast.....wish the tv's were decent. Nice nice patio!,0
"Lots of beers to choose from. Food is just not good. Everything is overprocessed, frozen and dripping with grease.",0
Cute museum. Really hot in the desert. Cool history lesson of how the Hohokam Indians lived back in the day.,0
"My favorite Mexican restaurant! Hash brown breakfast burrito is to die for, fish taco or fish burrito is excellent. My other fav is the shredded chicken burrito. Hard to have a bad meal here. Cheap too.",0
good beer selection- both on tap and in the beer cave. located in a nice neighborhood.  the chili cheese dog is fantastic and so are the fries!!,0
"GREAT Happy Hour!! $5/glasses of vino. Menu of samplings for $5 each! Try the flatbread pizza, the ceviche is yummy!!",0
"Come back, Angel Sweet!  Tried the gelato at what is now Gelato Spot.  They managed to kill the AS vibe.  Oh well - there is always Dairy Queen...",0
Expensive. Pedicure was about 15 minutes. I had to actually ask to get my cuticles cut. Won't go back,0
Had a horrible experience with this company a few months ago. My story sounds very similar to the ones posted on here already. Incredibly lousy customer service and an owner who could give a damn about filling orders and delivering service.,0
"Stellar beer selection, and though I am not a huge pizza person I loved theirs.  Service is always available a moment before you know you need another beer.  Great happy hour prices and atmosphere.",0
"Its ok, but I got sick from the corn dog. The cherry limeaide is alwayse a winner though.",0
We have been here for breakfast on many occasions and have never had a bad meal. Recently we tried the all you can eat Friday fish fry and it is wonderful. The clam chowder is excellent.,0
Completely charming. A true respite from the busy city!! I found something for the gardener that has everything.,0
"it was ok, no music or anything fun going on. He re polished my toes which lasted a long time. :-). Manicured my nails ok",0
Food was okay. Had the Aloha Bento.  The beef was tough.  Chicken and fish were good.,0
This store is all right everyone is being nice to me when I came in but it's kinda messy when I ray some clothes inside the fitting room.,0
Yea I come here often but don't ask for help they make you feel bad for asking like you are stopping them from heart surgery.,0
"Came here to get a quote on a paint job for our black 96 Integra GSR. Fantastic work on all the cars on the lot, you can tell this place is top notch.",0
General tsao's chicken for take-out lunch broke the plastic fork I was using.  I probably caught them on an off-day.,0
I wish I could give them no stars! Service sucks enough said. If it starts out bad it will stay bad. Stay away don't let them ruin your big day!,0
Went last Sunday waited an hour after ordering and waitress never said any thing to us so we asked for a take out and that took another 15 min food was ok but how about some communication,0
This location is CLOSED. \n\nYou can find them on the NW corner of Dobson & Baseline in Mesa now.,0
They have boba milk teas here in North Las vegas. \n\nEddie was excellent cashier. Bogo on milk teas and smoothies (:,0
"I had high hopes for this place and was let down by pricing and the food. Perhaps I just need to give it some more tries, I've been twice with no luck. It isn't bad but just ok.",0
The machines are worn out and old.  They really need to spend some money on new equipment. The free weight section Is fine though.,0
"I have been using discount tire for 25 years and swear by them.  Service is fast, efficient and they patched 1/2 a dozen tires for me for free.  No one else will ever get my business.",0
Very rude front desk clerk. Have a smoking room when I requested a non smoking room. Will not be coming back to this one.,0
Good choice for Mexican food in Charlotte. Enjoyed the flautas as well as the cheese dip. It is one of the best cheese dips I have had at a Mexican restaurant.  Highly recommend.,0
Don't need to show diamonds in the rough proof of vaccinations for them to groom your pet. You still need to Vaccinate your pet but proof is not required like some other pet stores.,0
"Great atmosphere, good service. Excellent food. I ordered the taco, enchilada, tostada combo. Very delicious. Loved the beans and rice.",0
Personally to me not worth the wait outside but interesting to see it in real life. The cast was of course not there and it looks just like any other pawn shop.,0
"Store is running on a shoe string, there are not enough employees to handle the store not to mention the employees. Appear to be on edge, which leaves me to be leave there is a management problem",0
"Decided it was time for a half-pound burger, had their bacon burger which was very good.  Not a real fan of the ambience and might stop by here on occasion.",0
"Non attentive staff, VERY rude bartender. Left before getting waited on!",0
Went to get a radio installed and installer named Bishop burned my car. Installers dont know nothing wish old installer named Eduardo still worked their,0
Went in at breakfast time it was semi busy...but not packed. Walked out after 45 mins of waiting for a sandwich. I went to the waffle house instead.,0
Food was great and was a nice change from the standard Mexican joint. Atmosphere was kinda like a cafeteria and lighting was way too bright. That said the food was a solid 3.5 stars. Atmosphere 2 with an average of 3.,0
"It's okay, but that's about it.   I also worry about cleanliness.   When the bathroom is dirty, and it was, I suspect the kitchen is worse.",0
Nothing off the charts but not bad for a simple lunch or dinner or to meet up with some friends.,0
The men's room was SUPER nasty.\n\nThe service was good...and the food was hot.,0
My SUV is 13 years old and has never had a wax job. The finish was dull and faded. Full Circle restored my vehicle's finish like new in about 3 hours.,0
Tasty burgers and onion rings. Clean and friendly. I'd go back again.,0
"I am sorry to say, we did not eat here, my friend and I went in Saturday evening, we were waiting to be seated, and had time to look around...dirty...we left.",0
"Understaffed. Checkout lines almost always long, staff rarely available to help. Not super clean. Will see if that improves at the new location...",0
Menu changed and the food is horrible and horribly overpriced. They are trying to go with a French flair and failed. DO NOT GO HERE. Gross!!,0
This place sucks. The food tasted like  glue. On top of the fact that they didn't want to seat me in an empty restaurant that never came close to filling. Over price d!!!,0
Chicago dog was awesome. Great selection of craft beers on draft too!,0
Service is incredibly substandard.  One would say reliably awful if you needed any assistance on the sales floor.  Shop online is the best option instead of dealing with a sales associate that is very obvious that he doesn't give a hoot.,0
I'll keep coming for dinner because the food is worth it,0
"Nice place, very rustic and southwestern. The prime rib was very tender and tasted great. The service could be a little quicker, but other than that its an outstanding family restaurant.",0
Only come here in the morning and get out quick. Because it becomes a war zone here very quickly. As the sun goes down the freaks and ghouls come out until it gets night where its the worst of the worst.,0
"The menu is overwhelmingly long and their food is pretty tasty.  There are options for vegans, vegetarians, and any other dietary restriction you can think of. I wouldn't protest another visit.",0
Not a bad place but it seems small and very limited on what they carry. The store is neat and clean but there is just lack of choices.,0
"Really enjoyed my Gyro for lunch today. The family run restaurant is fun, positive, friendly and yummy!",0
"Great place for chicken. I come here about 3 times a month, Love the corn and black bean sides",0
"Pedros has an awesome green corn tamales,  there salsa has a unique flavor and includes black olive pieces.  Very reasonable prices and modest decor. Closed on Sunday.",0
It is what it is. A budget airport hotel. The staff are friendly. The free cookies are fresh and tasty. We were there from 1230 - 6. Slept in a comfy bed. Had a hot shower. No complaints.,0
"The food is decent, not as good as before the move, but still good. They get bonus points for being open late, which is always a good thing.",0
"I can only speak of the bar scene, and not of the food.  It was a good time!  Wish they had been playing better music, however.",0
"Wanted to like, close to home, didn't get a server for 10 minutes, just wasn't impressed with the food, maybe it was just a bad night.",0
"Dirty table, bathroom, silverware and plates.  The appetizers came out cold and sloppy.  The potatoes were undercooked.  Not a fan.",0
Excellent eggplant parm!  Next time I'll try the meatballs.,0
"This is more like dungeons and dragons, it is so freaking dark in there. They have some good food, decent service. Nothing stands out just ok. The owner is a goof ball and trys to hit on every women in the place.",0
Nice atmosphere but not so nice hot chocolate. I can be a food/drink purist sometimes and I didn't like them using chocolate sauce for my drink. Eww.,0
"Food is what you expect.  The ambience is ok inside, and sometimes it takes awhile to get a drink.  It's got a good crowd though.",0
If you have any respect for your taste buds and stomach...don't just don't even try this place because the grease and soggy ness will knock you over and kill the rest of your mall experience,0
Good little neighborhood spot. Friendly faces and average food. Nice happy hour specials.,0
"Great brew house. Had the beer tasting, which was delicious. And the spinach and artichoke dip which was also fantastic!! Huge chunks of artichoke and creamy cheese. Seriously, I'm thinking about it right now.",0
Found a place plastic coated wire in my food delivered last night. I'm disgusted and will never eat this food again!,0
"Definitely a great little spot for lunch or dinner. The appetizers, some of them, are big enough to have as a meal.",0
The store had expectable service and a decent stock of tools.I had a small project in my studio that was taking place just last month and they had the right stuff.This particular shop is good stuff.,0
Love this place!! Not too pricey and so much food. Tacos are amazing and they make the guacamole in front of you.,0
"Love their food, definitely hits the spot!!! I recommend the whiskey penne pasta or killer Mac 'n cheese -- and for dessert, the Kahlua ice cream mud pie.",0
Save your money and go to the freezer section of your local grocery store. Some of those are far tastier. \nYou can call yourself NY all you want but no one in NY would ever eat this distasteful cardboard.,0
I love all you can eat buffet and the stake house the cafe restraunt I eat slots of food and I am still skinny I love that ever play machines there and sports tickets,0
Always great and fast! Service is always top notch. Beware of big crowds during lunch.,0
"The chipotle chicken panini was delicious and large.  Very hot, flavorful, juicy, and reasonably priced (especially for an airport).  They even gave me a delicious chocolate chip cookie.  Definitely recommend.",0
The dishware is dirty. I can see leftover soy sauce on my spoon. Cup are also leftover tea marks.,0
I've never gotten food poisoning here. I have gotten screwed up orders alot. It would be nice to deal with more Americans though. All in all it's an average Del Taco.,0
"Food has good flavor, but I would have preferred a bigger portion of meat and hotter food. They really aren't out to impress, only to fill your belly.",0
"OK....so it's a bona fide feed trough.  Better to bring your avarice and appetite here, and get a few veggies.",0
Go somewhere else. Long wait at the drive thru. After they take your order. They make you pull up and make you wait for a long time for your order.  Like I said. Go somewhere else.,0
I had the ribs they were great.  The beer selection needs work.  I do not understand why places like this have Bud Light on the menu.  There should be a lot more craft beers on the menu.,0
Foods always pretty good. The key is to get good service! Skyelar was a stellar waitress! Very polite ad attentive!! She kept our drinks full and chips full!,0
"Was in the area and decided to get our \""toes did\"". Great chairs and not a long wait. They did a good job. Affordable $$ paid $23. The girls that worked on us were really nice and funny!",0
Had the chicken salad sandwich and was not impressed. Bread was whatever. Setting is cool but I probably won't be back. Expected more from these yelp ratings.,0
"It was decent for the price - it was cheap, but clean and quiet.  Travis at the front desk was quite helpful and understanding of our unique situation.",0
"If you love spicy food this is the place for you. I always feel like a get great service everytime I come. I bring my family often because We always enjoys the food, spirits, and service.",0
"Amazing place with many choices~ if you are around this area, definitely stop by and get some fresh fruit as well",0
Staff was helpful.  I was overwhelmed.  But the fabric rocked and that's what counts!,0
"I have been here about 5 times. Every time I go, they do a great service. The staff is always helpful and create a great atmosphere. Defiantly worth the $$$$.",0
This is a decent place for lunch. The vegetables are a little watery but the fried chicken is really good. I didn't like their cornbread because it was icky sweet (like a cake).,0
Awful. These idiots have destroyed several of my shirts as well as several of my wife's dresses. They also iron wrinkles into my suits and shirts.  To top it off they overcharge and they're rude.,0
"I didn't have much of a view from my room on the club level.  However, the facility was clean and quiet.",0
"Great food, but you'll pay for it!  Not cheap...  Plus some of the servers aren't Japanese, geez.",0
"After reading the reviews I decided to stop by and I was a little disappointed, not as good as all the reviews suggested.",0
Its way too cold in the dining room. I cannot even enjoy the free WiFi because I am freezing. They should offer free hot chocolate because of the icy temp inside. What we need is heat not cold...its cold enough outside...,0
Horrible greasy food.\nGm didn't care at all when we complained.\nManagement reflects overall very poor experience. My tummy still hurts!,0
I walk in at 7:30 the doors are open they let me pick my fish then tell me the don't cook after 7:30 nice doing business with you,0
"Been looking for good \""hole in the wall\"" Mexican in Charlotte for over a year, glad I finally found this place. The salsa, queso, and chimi are all very good, much better than Azteca!",0
I prefer Wingstop. BWW didn't win me as a customer. Good sport restaurant to watch games though.,0
All is good here. The waiters and the owner are friendly. \nThe space may be so tiny especially at lunch time. Bring your cash and don't forget to tip :),0
Great place to watch a game. The food is good and the beer prices make my husband happy. We like to share the two for $20 meal deal!,0
Unimpressive... I'd rather go to Panda Express. I didn't even finish my food.,0
Not worth the price. I would not go back. Pretty unexciting.,0
Delivery was delivered on time when requested. Delivery man was friendly. Food on the other hand was far from statisfying. Have had better food in the past. Disappointed this time,0
Beer was cold. That is about all I got,0
Bread is great but not enough meat on the subs. Buts it's also owned by different people then the one near uptown Charlotte.,0
Great food fast.  Clean place.  Good service.  Try the shrimp burrito and fish tacos.,0
Large clean room.  Booked through hotels.com about an hour before we arrived and got the best price.  Breakfast had a good variety.  Staff was friendly.,0
Always an hour wait. My cats would get sick every time after coming home from here. They are strictly indoor cats. Also way over priced even on the half off days.,0
Best doctor I've ever been to. He has discovered things about my health no one has ever found out about me. He is thorough and actually remembers who you are every time you come in. His office also gets you in same day usually.,0
"Stopped in for a quick lunch. Gyro pita wrap with Greek salad. Service was quick and friendly. Food was tasty and well made. \n\nAs always, a good experience.",0
"I've been to Hawaii a couple of times to visit an old friend who moved there. Whenever I crave a plate lunch here on the mainland like they do on the island, I usually hit up Aloha Kitchen.",0
Great customer service! Manager came around greeting guest and asking if meal was good.,0
Gross!! I tried it cuz I woke across the street but OMG... dry ass food... I wanted to puke!!,0
"Don't waste your time... Ick! It's already dry enough in Arizona, don't think we need our food like that too...",0
First time eating Indian food.  Great staff great food.  clean.  All around excellent.  Can't wait to try it again.,0
Yummy big wings! They also are very good on keeping up with drinks And condiments such the extra napkins and plates for our wings when we had joiners to our table.,0
Stopped in for breakfast. Ordered a coffee and a Taylor ham and egg.  The Blueberry scone was wonderful. I will go back when I am in town again.,0
We eat here at least once a week. The service is awesome and the food is always good.,0
"Very bad food. Located in a seedy part of town. Was actually afraid walking in.\nNothing was good. Even with the low standards of Indian restaurants in Charlotte, this one should be avoided",0
I had a bad experience here. The 2 women behind the counter were very rude and kept rolling their eyes at me. I was very offended. I will be taking my business somewhere else next time. so disappointing.,0
Wow. Ordered 3 dishes - all great. Blueberry muffins and the press tuna sandwich is to die for. I'm digging this place - perhaps my top 3 breakfast joint worldwide.,0
"The service at Mr. Roberts is okay, but the free live music is what pulls me in! Drinks are reasonably priced too.",0
"Food was ok, nothing great. Food network would say it needs salt. Worst thing was that they are cash only. Who does that anymore? Even the old lady behind me was digging for quarters.",0
Went there this past weekend and had Steak & Lobster. Really love the taste of the food and customer service was great.,0
This dentist is by far the worst I have ever been to. His manner is rude and if you won't get everything he recommends he does not seem to care. Just a mean man.,0
The pizza here is good after a drunken night out in old town. It's just a bit greasy.,0
Food is very good.  Atmosphere is okay.  Staff is tops!,0
Okay I gave it another try for a friends birthday and I actually had a blast! It was a sunday and we had a table but it was a really good time. I'd go again with a group of friends :),0
Too crowded.  The only thing I remember is the sweet potato fries.  Delicious.  But not worth the trip.,0
"This restaurant was just okay to me.  I ordered a thin crust and it was just average.  The garlic cheese bread was the best part of the meal. It was tasty.  The staff was friendly, so that was a plus.",0
This was a great local hangout. Delicious thin crust pizza (we had the Big Johnson) and inexpensive beer. Tonight they had a fantastic guitar duo. Really fun to hang out and see the locals and watch a game or two.,0
Never go to Just Brakes. Such bait and switch people. Ask them who comes in and gets a $99 brake job. Almost no one.,0
Wasn't busy but had to wait a little. Food was a little cold on my fiance and son's plate but was discounted. My food came out awesome.,0
"all things considered this place rocks. \n\nPrice, speed, quality all 5 stars. \n\nThe wings are good too, nice pepper flavor in there.",0
poor service took them 3 weeks to fix one darn bumper. NEVER do business with them EVER again.,0
"If you have time to kill, you can gamble. Unlike most airports, you would get bored.",0
"I really enjoyed the service I received at this Outback. I know that restaurants are often busy and I usually feel like the personal, friendly service is sacrificed but we were treated very well.",0
Nice folks but the water softening system has a CAM/Piston that fails often.  Unless they change that I would not buy this unit.,0
"Have been to this Good Egg many times, the food never disappoints. Great place for breakfast or lunch and even coffee!",0
"Long time favorite place of mine.  I stick with the Cheese Steak and can never finish a full one.  If you order in, you get fries included.\n\nThey usually have some cheaper specials for kids.",0
"Pretty expensive, but the flavor can be improved much. The salmon smells weird.",0
they had a pretty big selection of beef jerky and snacks and other candies. the one pound bags are kinda pricey but all the smaller stuff are pretty reasonable. defininitly coming back next year.,0
"Love the limeade.  The new hot dogs taste great, and actually look like the pictures you see on the ads.  How often does that happen?",0
Great menu and service is fantastic. Lunch at noon with five of us took less than hour and portions. I will make this my new go to lunch spot with clients and friends alike.,0
Getting in and out of the parking lot is a b!tch.,0
Great friendly service. Consistent food quality every time. It's nice to come back and see the same team working so well together. Always a pleasant experience!,0
Went through the drive thru  for just dessert and waited 15 minutes. Maybe longer.  the time i went through was at 12:17am in the morning. Usually the service here is pretty quick.,0
"Their service was nice, but the quality of bagel wasn't what other reviewers said.  Very disappointed since I am new to Phoenix.  I don't know how other reviewers gave 5 stars.",0
I ordered a large pepperoni pan pizza togo. I normally like pizza hut but for some  reason the pizza seemed way to greasy and didn't taste that great. In fact I got naseous after eating 2 slices.,0
"I love this spot. Good drinks decent food although I don't care for the rice at all. All the servers are prompt and friendly, I come here often",0
"Had several vehicles 5% tint. Always an excellent job. Taking my abarth there Monday. Can't wait. \nRecommend times a thousand. If you're looking for a tint guy, look no further.",0
The first experience we had here was amazing.  Had a follow up trip for V-day and I was really unimpressed. All 4 courses that night really failed to impress,0
Went to a wedding. The food was ok and the drinks were way over priced 5 for a soda and 6 for a bottle of water! Really! 16 for a mixed drink.,0
Great for any occasion. The salty sundae is unusual and fantastic.  The bruschetta addictive.,0
"Go here.  Get a cheap hot dog.  A bum will ask you for it.  Go ahead and keep it.  It's your hot dog, after all.\n\nMmmm.  Hot dog.",0
"Over priced vs Quality.  Service is hit and miss, depending on time of day.",0
"DIM SUM! my fave thing, shrimp balls. they're salt/pepp shrimp is comparable here to other places bc it's gross....",0
"Good Chinese take out...never been disappointed here. \n\nThe food is always good, service is friendly, and delivery is extremely prompt.",0
"This is the worst Mexican restaurant!!  Horrible food, horrible service!  Went to this location because I had a coupon, but I would have rather paid full price somewhere else.  Would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",0
good for that quick get togeather with the girls..,0
"It is what it is: a small, standing room only rock club. The drinks are overpriced compared to other venues in town.",0
"Horrifying.  This place should be ashamed of itself.  DO NOT STAY HERE.  Beyond dirty, just absolutely rank.",0
We LOVED La Fontanella and were so sad to hear they had closed. A neighborhood gem that has been around for years and years. Bummer!,0
Just got rolled by this cab company! Cab lady took us from the Stratosphere all the way South of town to the Airport. It cost $46.00 and took about 25 minutes!!! DO NOT DRIVE WITH THESE PEOPLE!!!!!,0
Love the selection. Been shopping here for years. The employees however are always rude and shouldn't even work in the public. Normally I grab what I need and get out of there fast as possible.,0
Great location but low on amenities.  HVAC system is ancient and the noise factor on Fifth Avenue is problematic. The price is nice but that's all I can say about the positive.,0
"Its a vegas casino, there is really nothing special, it has a movie theater, some average casino food and an average vegas hotel.",0
"My husband likes them, I don't.  He likes the bean burritos with cheese and sour cream, but at around five bucks each and nothing exciting, I would definitely go elsewhere.",0
"My favorite Thai food restaurant. Their soy meat is soo good, and their Penang with soy duck is to die for. I would eat here everyday if it wasn't so far from my house. It's a must try for everyone!",0
I thought the pizza was a little too oily. It wasn't bad though.,0
Always great food and great service. The Prickly Pear sandwich is a classic. I recommend the chicken wings and pizza. The restaurant has a cozy feel and it's great to patronize a locally owned establishment.,0
Its our second time here and they messed up our order both times and the service is horrible.,0
"Best ribs in town!  Love coming here, lots to eat and friendly staff.  The restaurant on Thunderbird is our favorite.  You won't be disappointed, I guarantee.",0
"Very sad to learn that where the best meal I've ever had in my life is no more. Phoenix, you have lost a gem.",0
We had a party of 6. Five out of six steaks had issues with one served raw. Horrible experience. The manager was not apologetic at all. Very disappointed.,0
Pretty good and a step above most fast food. Buffalo chicken sub with lettuce and tomatoes was solid and good-- enough for 2 meals.,0
"Moved here over a year ago. Was able to move in a timely manner into my apartment. Staff is extremely helpful, neighbors are friendly and it's quiet. I love this place.",0
"Would not use as a shipping service, they are extremely slow to process even if there is no one in line. Makes even the post office look good.",0
I have never had a bad meal at the Dish. This place is a hidden Gem. Great Chicken and Dumplings.,0
Innovative southwestern cooking. Small plates can make a meal. The duck confit relleno is to die for. Truly a first class wine list.,0
This place is outstanding great food friendly helpful service and very reasonably priced it's just not fancy definetly a favorite,0
We went here as a family.  Music was pretty loud and the food was average at best.  We won't go back again it felt more like a college bar and not a place for families.,0
when you walk in the place speaks for itself. I like the Katsu Chicken. Im not pleased with most everything else.,0
"meh... they have a lot of the standard expected whole food health support products, BUT if you want excellent service and need a helping hand searching for your nutriceuticals, I'd head straight over to Pure Health on Washington and Buffalo.",0
Such a great low key place to go and have a great dinner. Their Fried pickles are amazing and have an awesome beer selection! This is my go to place for a fun relaxing evening dinner uptown.,0
After going there every week since it reopened I was treated like dirt last week.  After being treated so poorly we were on our way and opened the bag to find an order that was wrong..... AGAIN!!!!,0
"13 to the gallows plays there sometimes, my favorite band. the place is great, cheap drinks and great sound!!",0
"Stay off the strip and stay here!  Unlike the strip, you'll never have to get in your car or take a taxi.  With Fremont Street at the corner, an interesting evening is only a few steps away.",0
Any yelpers know where Sue is working now? She was amazing and she's left this place. I'll follow her if I know where to go?,0
Don't even bother. This place is a ghost town with less than bright servers.,0
Horrible place to stay asked for non smoking room smelled like cigarettes bad customer service wifi is horrible did not work kids running around at 2 in the morning up and down hall ways,0
"They didn't seem enthusiastic about helping me w/ a custom design. And, the cat they have wandering the store vomited at my feet.",0
Amazing authentic vietnamese food. Not to mention it's very cheap! Love it! I recommend the Pho... Delicious! It reminds me of the little restaurants that dot the streets in Vietnam.,0
LOYAL local's lunch spot. Great service. Average food. Complimentary soup.,0
"Good food but pricey. No salad with entry, just cold bread. Very large portions",0
It's an airport.  It's ok.  Nothing special.  It's not bad but it gets me to and form where I need to go!,0
"I stopped in looking for a table for just myself. They wouldn't seat just me at a table, and their sushi bar was reserved.",0
Looked like a mom and pop place. Tried it for the first time and it was good Mexican food. I had a beef torta and bean and cheese burrito. Price is cheap and reasonable.,0
Great food. Restaurant is undergoing renovation - but don't let that stop you from going there.,0
I swing by because I decorate cakes. The cake decorating section is piss poor.,0
"Not a bad place to day drink, but that's about it. I've eaten here a number of times and it has always left something to be desired. Food is very average.",0
"Average. Nothing great, nothing terrible. Food was good enough and the people were a little rude, but all in all, you get what you pay for.",0
"Great BBQ, Sauce is great, Cole slaw is good, no complaints for me. It's a BBQ shack, so anybody expecting frills will be greatly disappointed. It's all about the food and that is great.",0
"Excellent food, excellent price. Especially for lunch!",0
While I love Harkins theaters this one hasn't been updated as much as others have.  It's a great theater to see art house films.  Staff here is awesome!,0
I find myself here once a week. Would be a great place if the service was half descent.  However the service plain old sucks and the servers are no help they speak Zero english. Other then that not bad tea.,0
"Always a fun atmosphere, and with in walking distance of ASU, yay! \nI've tried a few appetizers and drinks and it was all very good!",0
My first mcdonald when i got to america. The playground smells horrible.,0
"Their food is ok.  I would not call it special or extraordinary, but it is not bad.  The service is less than desirable.",0
"All you can eat special is a great buy. Food is served hot and accurately cooked to order. Service is very friendly. Nothing fancy, good comfort food better than fast food.",0
"Honest, trustworthy, fair pricing, flexible. I feel very fortunate to have found a mechanic i dont have to doubt!",0
"I needed to kill time while waiting for my car wax. Got some assorted sundries. Clean, nice staff",0
Its a pizza hut what do you expect. Alot more than was delivered here. We had a party of 12 and there were 2 slices of pizza on the buffet line. The pizza was typical pizza chain fair.,0
Big turnover at this location...Looks like there is little training.\nI used them for a few months and then changed to another groomer.,0
What a wonderful restaurant. Patio is fantastic with live music in the background that you only sort of hear. Service was outstanding. Only possible complaint was that it was too dark to see your meal but it sure tasted great!,0
The smoke smell did get to me during my visit. The slots were fun and we did enjoy the casino. My kids enjoyed the bowling and workout room,0
A $13 steak as good as some $50 steaks I've had.,0

"This place is absolutely horrible.  Worst service ever.  What's worse is the manager didn't even care when we brought it up.  Also, food sucked.  I saw someone reviewed it as El Suckalo- I agree.",0
This place uses to be about us members but now they are no better then the big banks out there. They will hit you up with fees and even charge a monthly membership fee!  Barf!,0

"The food is not good, and the service is really bad. They added the tips to the bill by themselves, which is very rude.",0
Really good carne asada fries and less than five minutes from the strip \n\nTheir green sauce is good too. Definitely a hit and I wouldn't mind eating here again,0
"Best pizza! My absolute favorite. This is a family owned place!! Wish there were more, but I will drive to surprise in a heartbeat for this pizza.",0
"Pizza here is actually really good. The crust is nice and crisp, just like i like it. Refills are not free (soda) and their other menu items are not impressive. Get the pizza!",0

I will never come back to this restaurant again. The worst service I've ever experienced.  Watch out for being overcharged on your bill.,0

"Go on a weekday! You almost have the place to yourself. If you go on a weekend or holiday, forget it!! You're dodging strollers and kids wherever you go!!",0

"Great quick service   Leo did my nails,  funny guy.  Suggested a color I would never have choose but turned out cute.",0
Update: We had to drop this to a 3 star due to the horrible service. We had the worst waitress who acted like she was doing us a favor. Wish I caught her name. Lots of freckles and dark hair.,0
Very big and a great place to stop to pick up foods for lunch or dinner. Other cool shops near by. Dont go out of your way but if your in the west village stop in.,0
Lived here for 6 yrs and never tried this place. That was a big mistake ad this place is great. We will definitely be back!,0

Dive bar.  $2 draft beers.  Need I say more?,0

"Whoa. Those were some damn good waffles. \n\nI recommend spooning half of the butter off your grits, cause once it melts there's not room in the bowl for the both of them!",0
Good solid deli fare. I have tried several sandwiches and they have all left me satisfied. I suggest they invest a little in the atmosphere if they want people to dine in (maybe they don't).,0
Had the pasta special last night at Mama's and it was unreal.  Pure breast meat chicken bolognese in a tomato sauce with perfectly cooked rigatoni. Chef Drew hits another home run.,0
"If you love long lines and only 4 or less lanes open, then this is the place to be. The lines are long and the cashiers are usually old people who take their time with everything.",0
"I didn't eat because, well, the line was about 30 feet long.\n\nBut they had a fire dancer and tarot readings outside.\n\nMeh.",0
"Great lunch specials!  I got the Chicken Chow Mein, it was really good.  I would definitely go back again.",0
Only 2 stars for location. Rooms are humid and smell like wet dog. Worst hotel I have yet to stay in as a consultant.,0

"Greasy food and cheap beer.  Light on the wallet and heavy on the style.  Tattoos and bikes everywhere.  A must stop in Charlotte.  Burgers, fried pickles, and coney dogs are all awesome.",0
It has gone downhill. Hour wait for less than mediocre job. I have been so many times and it keeps getting worse.,0
This is a great store. Jamie and crew really go out of their way to serve you the best car and the best rate!,0
Met friends for happy hour and dinner.  Outdoor patio was fantastic!  Decent margarita at a decent price. The chips and salsa were good. Not the most authentic in Mexican food but overall a nice evening.,0

"Hallelujah, I feel amazing!!  just wanted to thank my massage therapist for doing an awesome job!!!  I needed this today...",0
"Great variety, so so food. I didn't feel great after eating here. Filthy restaurant. The value is in the Mongolian stir fry. If you stick with that, you can't go wrong for the price.",0
"Great food for unbelievably low prices; wonderful service, what else can you ask for? Love this place!",0
"Great wine store/bar.  I have been to several of their wine tastings, and I always enjoy myself.  Cute merchandise, great wine selections.  Very comfortable place.",0

"I've eaten here a couple times in the last few weeks, for the price you get a real good selection. I'm going to go there again in a couple days.",0
Have only been here for lunch as I work around the corner and don't live too close. The pizza has been excellent every time as well as the service. If you like think crust not greasy pizza - give them a try.,0

Good place with decent drink prices.  Wish they were open a little earlier...,0
Overall an OK hotel. Stayed here a few times. The prices are usually a lot more fair than hotels closer to Vegas. \n\nGreat hotel to stay at when in town for Supercross.,0
"Two visits in one week (last week)! Big servings, quick and friendly staff, cozy atmosphere. The price is great, too.\n\nIf you like coconut dishes, check out the Red Thai Curry with Chicken.",0
I finally tried their food and it was a good thing to do. Descent pizza and good selection of dessert!,0
The food and service is amazing great authentic mechladas. The red chile is amazing and so is the chips and salsa. Beware salsa is so good yet so hot. Its painfully good. Yum yum yum,0
een coming here for years and it's still my favorite place to get some oysters.\nEnjoy some clams strips and beers out on the patio. Great atmosphere!,0
I've been coming to this place for 3 years and I've had good customer service so far. I've ordered a few minutes before closing and they've accommodated me.,0
"I entered the place one afternoon.  The people working there were so f**king rude, that I had to leave!",0
They have the best Paprdelle I've ever had.\nGreat service too.,0
Dr. Andriola is the only reason we go here. The wait is usually long and I notice that those without an appointment usually get seen quicker then those that do.,0
I like this airport.  I don't like how long it takes to get your bags when you arrive & the security lines... but other than that it's a nice airport.,0
The waitress was overwhelmed. Other servers were not. Food took forever & was luke warm. I sent the fried perch back in hopes of getting something Hot. Didn't really make a difference.,0
Worst place ever the casino smells they hav\n\ne a ridiculous parking garage with 20 minute wait just to exit really awful place don't care about customers just making money employees clearly not happy,0
"Estimated delivery time 45 minutes actually delivery time 120 minutes.\n\nPizza Hut, a pizza of last resort.",0
What I liked about this place was that it looks like you have landed on Mars. Just check out some of the rock formations outside. What I do not like about this place is that it is in Arizona. Enough said.,0
Not the place to be. Crowd was dull. Music was ok,0
We all liked playing golf here.  Service and friendliness were good.  This place is best for straight hitters as the fairways were long and narrow.  Nice looking holes and very challenging greens.,0
"it's a school, enough said. not sure what they are teaching in there but my nephew comes home saying things like \"" that's COO\"" or \""uncle i'm gonna be late for SCHOO\"".",0
"Food is good, customer service is horrible, they all have attitudes especially this older really thin lady",0
"Average food, average service. Marinara sauce over spaghetti was far too sweet. Tasted like canned. Italian sausage was bland at best. Wine selection was average and overpriced.  Would not recommend.",0
For some reason this location isn't as good as the rest. The dining is always dirty and the patio looks like crap.,0
"Good food and good service. We ate there on Christmas Day at dinner time while traveling. The servers were cheerful, friendly, and efficient even after being there many hours. I would definitely go there again if we are in the area.",0
A bit out of my price range...but I love coming here to look and get ideas.,0
"umm..yea, all I will say is not-so-great.  For what it is, its expensive and the owner is a jerk.",0
Please count your change before leaving this location! I was not given the correct change on two occasions and notices before walking out.,0

"Went to Harper's yesterday to eat, but as soon as I saw the B rating, we left.",0
"Consistently good catered sandwiches, pasta salads, and pickles! A lunch time favorite.",0
Far from the madding crowd...super food and service,0
"Went here once, had some kind of chicken that I think was frozen, not fresh. The sauce tasted like something out of a can I think, it was definitely not home made. Will not return...",0
Meat and chicken is high a quality-customer service gets three stars though-unfriendly staff at times-with high prices they charge excellent customer service should be an expectation.,0
Their drive thru service at night is horrible. The lady was being rude to us and gave us hard chicken nuggets that were like rocks. I'm never going back to that place.,0
"Good, typical diner-style food. Breakfast is served hot, fresh, and fast. Family-friendly and family-run. The decor is dated, but the restaurant is very clean. Service is fantastic.",0
"Good pizza  & good service, I do the delivery thing here and so far, so good.",0
"Fausto's is good and cheap. It's home of the \""Super Duper Snacktastic Nacho's\"". (Name should be on the Menu some day)",0
"The best Italian in Charlotte.  Period.  I have been going there on Sunday night for 20 years.  The food, the people and the ambience cannot be replaced by any other restaurant I have ever frequented.",0
Went there with two friends on a trip to Vegas and it was wonderful.  Atmosphere top notch. Staff was professional and friendly and prices reasonable.  Definite stop in vegas!,0
Bigger airport than one would think. Very busy and always on the move. Easy to get around however.,0
chicken buns werent good. egg custard tart not good. ham and cheese bun not good.,0
"This is surprising gem of a restaurant. The food is very tasty, service was great. \n\nI'd go back for a special evening.",0
Hacked...would give 3 out of 5 for a few minor things,0
Denied service because our party of 7 is too big?! They can't sit parties larger than 4. Happy to take my service else where.,0
Steak was not cooked properly. After the second attempt still wrong\n.. gave up.  \n\nGood sweet potato though!\n\nNot my most favorite place for steak.,0
"If you're looking for a great corner dive with interesting folks, witty bartenders, decent bar food, cheap drinks, low drama, and weekly sex trivia, you found it.",0
The service is super slow!  We've been waiting for our food for an hour!  Still waiting...,0
"Good but not great.  The food is consistent just lacks the? factor that makes you say, Let's have that tonight!  It's standard chinese food fair.",0
If you at all a Frank Lloyd Wright fan you must take the time to visit Taliesin West. The place is beautiful and the 60 minute tour we took was just right. There are longer tours also available.,0
Terrible place to get service if you are a young single female.,0
"would come back again, didn't get to eat just had chips & salsa.  Would not get the margarita again.  Good atmaspher",0
"FIrst time at a Supper Club. Tons of fun! Definitely a different experience. Cod is delicious. Two pieces is plenty with all the extras you get (rolls, potato, salad, relish tray...)",0
Service is slow in the bar area. Not many people here either.  Bartender more interested in her phone. 40 min wait for two salads.,0
This place argues with you allll the time.  They won't do anything for you and want to make you  pay 4 times the rates of other vets.  DO  NOT GO HERE!,0
Always a smooth experience both ways...flying in and out.,0
"Only place I will go! I get my hair cut, eyebrows waxed, nails and pedicures done here. There is sometimes a wait, but only because they are that good! Best pedicure I've ever had!",0
"Call ahead. This place is so busy during lunch, you'll never make it during a regular lunch hour if you don't!",0
My regular pharmacy! Darcy the pharmacist is the best and gets your Rx filled in 20 mins. or less. Fast service with a smile!,0
"We stayed recently in a very nice suite. Beautiful decor -- especially the tile floors in the entry, bathroom & powder room. Really enjoyed the spa and pool here. Standard Marriott level of service.",0
"Eh. Ok food, high school waitresses, blah bar. Wish I liked it more, but blah.",0
These pretzels are a guilty pleasure once in awhile when I go to the mall-- yum!  Their lemonade is pretty disappointing though. Way too tart!,0
hey this place is pretty good my friend told me there is some in cali never seen or been there before i was surprise how good it is had there tacos they are great one of the best i ever had.,0

Had dinner here last night. It's was ok. Not what I expected. Semi cafeteria type service.,0
"Ew.\n\nThats a compliment, too.\n\nI don't want syrup in my martini and I've had better sushi from the grocery store.  I'd rather stay home.",0
Totally disappointing casino.  With a name like hooters you expect a little more showmanship in the casino floor.,0
Kids Tennis training is expensive but good. They have 3 coaches and group the kids into one of the group based on skills. \n\nBad Part : The coaching starts at 5 PM and very bad when both parents are working.,0
This hotel lodge was excellent. It is Christmas Eve and the service was just excellent. The lady was so sweet and nice working the lobby..not even giving it a thought but helping and being cheerful! Excellent food and great area!,0

Best place in da 'burgh for the frequent traveler!,0
Lines at TSA PreCheck is short. Love it.,0
Good food and open 24 hours. Anytime I stop by Las Vegas I have to be here at least one time for lunch or dinner. Wonton soup is the best.,0
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! It has fast service and super great food. I've been to other pho joints but their pho broth doesn't even compare. Also they give hugh sides of all the extras that go in the soup.,0
"Hey, at least the guy didn't ask \""what can we get started for you\"". He knew I just wanted coffee. Medium coffee. Thanks.",0
This is the best Chili's in Charlotte. Consistently awesome! Great boneless buffalo wings and the best mac and cheese.,0
Just nothing that exciting. I'm not a beer person so this is mainly food related.,0
Not too impressed but again I'm not used to north Carolina BBQ.  Service was great best fried pickles I've ever had,0

"Gross, I dont understand this place at all.",0
"Not exactly an upscale mall by a long shot.  Service is horrendous and it is crowded and messy, with a poor selection of low grade stores.",0
It's old.  It's small.  The staff was attentive.  Food showed up quick and tasted like IHOP food.,0
Great food always!  Rice and beans are great.  Happy hour is very good as well. Get the $3 house margaritas!,0
Some of the best pizza I've had since moving to Pittsburgh. And they have good hoagies as well.,0

Rooms are really nice. Like nice size apartments. WiFi is not free.,0

"This place is terrible, there food was cold and i had an undercooked chicken it was horrible the quantity on my plate was very low the pricing is crazy too overpriced absolute bad dinner",0
This is one of those airports I've had multiple layovers in but that I haven't actually explored much.  It serves its purpose.,0

Decent french bistro.  The Parmesan truffle fries are delicious the Monte Cristo is excellent.  Great place to have a nice lunch outside and people watch.,0
Absolutely love this nail salon! Everyone there was so nice and welcoming. This salon is definitely going to be a place that I will be going to more often.,0
Good for very modern furniture. Quality looks excellent. Found a complete lack of help from sales floor.,0
Very disappointed! Overpriced on Char Siew and Roast pork if you get them together on a small plate. What's even worse is the taste gone downhill!,0
"Creepy bar scene hahahaha Good thing I was in good company.  The drinks were strong at least, perhaps to mask the weird people that show up.  \n\nGlendale bars are weird man",0
Had a mushroom cheese steak. Normally a very tender juicy sandwich. Not this time. Tough and dry. Trainee needs more supervision and training.,0
"Old and kind of dirty. \""Cafe\"" could not be slower if they tried. Very limited selection of everything.",0
Absolute garbage we went to grab a quick dinner the other night. I ended up with food poisoning and missed work and vacation. I will never return to this location again!,0
I am SO addicted to the vegetarian Thai dynamite. I don't think I will ever be able to order anything else. The tofu lettuce wraps are also a must EVERYTIME.,0
"Meh sums it up. There are better middle eastern places out there, but if you're in the neighborhood, this will do. It's decent, just not much to write home about.",0
"I love the beer, love the steak, love the atmosphere. They've had some great live musicians when I've gone, too.",0
"Not the safest one in the world, had a guy walk up on me for some money. People just standing around not going any where never a great sign. And they always forget your straw.",0
Love this place.  Never had a bad meal.  Good portions and great people.  Be ready to stand in line.,0
"Clean taxi but these people are unreliable. 30 minutes late when I needed a cab ride to the airport. They already \""picked me up\"" without even calling to tell me the taxi was here. Poor service.",0
Would not use them. They could not even get a surprise flower delivery executed correctly.,0
New Mexico style food.  Tasty and big portions.  A beautiful patio area out back.,0
"Avoid this place.  Its super loud, and the weird seating gimmick is a nightmare.  Food was nothing better than average.",0
"The staff here is great, but the layout is a bit odd. Ladies literally freeze their asses off in the winter just to pee! Small intimate venue, i do like that it has two different bars, and music genres.",0
"Best bar on Walnut.\nGo here anytime of day,\nThey will have your fix.\n\n(b)",0
I agree with the previous comment. This place is old and dirty!! I can't say anything wrong about the service because I don't really care about that... Lol,0
"I know my friends like this place.  But to me the service was lazy and veryy slow. Gnats flying all around, and the soda was flat.  The waitress said it wasn't.  No paper towels in the bathroom.",0
"Great food and atmosphere. Had the mixed grill, a little bit everything on one piping hot plate.  Dessert was great too, always a fan of rice pudding.",0

"Usually Have a great experience but the last time was awful! The host was very rude and our server Jeffrey was slow and sarcastic (in a bad way) the food is always great, but over all dealing with the staff was not worth it!",0
I'm not even sure where to start.  Horrible!,0
"Went in for the Princess Platter with my wife and very much enjoyed the meal.  Service was good, we would certainly return",0
Food is pretty good. Always go during the day. The night shift is ratchet! Seriously! Very selfish with bags. They will try to stuff everything in one bag. Dining area is clean.,0
Chandler public library main branch includes a gift shop and coffee spot run by the Friends of the Chandler Public Library.  Collections include many CDs and videos in addition to books and magazines.,0
This location is the main Borders in the Las Vegas Valley.  They have the largest book selection and that is all they sell.  Don't expect a large music or DVD selection as this one primarily focuses on books.,0
"Like what other reviewers said, this airport screams \""Welcome to Vegas!\""  yep... slot machines everywhere.   It's a busy airport but their straightforward and functional layout helps make the flow of people relatively smooth.",0
We arrived at the door at 9:04pm and we were told that they closed at 9pm. Our party of 5 went elsewhere. Hard to below they could not use the extra business. Very short sighted imho.,0
"Spring Harbor has changed direction since my previous review.  Dr sondel was my reason for being there.  He is gone.  Not a bad place, but not the best anymore.",0
"Service was great, and always an interesting time on a late Saturday night.",0
"Meh, indeed.  Decent beer and excellent service. But it's chain food and it didn't do much for me.",0
Wasn't too impressed with their food. We tried a variety of their rolls and nothing stood out. Sakana's still the best!,0
"OK location, but the management is a joke.  Seriously lacking in customer service, follow-through and overall professionalism.",0
Don't stay here. You have to carry your own luggage up the stairs. No elevator.  Staff not helpful at all.,0
"Have been here a few times and there was one staff who was really rude. Girl, if you can't have better customer service, you may only be a barista for your whole life. Guess I'll not go back there again.",0
Very authentic diner style food.  We enjoy this place mostly because it s a serious hidden hideaway place.  And it is amazing for kids.,0
"Been looking for new rugs for my kitchen floor, and since I wanted something with a Little padding, it was hard finding something to fit my expectation. I did find it at Lvesac Galleria",0
"Good food, reasonable prices. I've been to the location on Univ avenue and it's pretty good.",0
"meh...........as a native Pittsburgher, I think this place is trendy and overpriced.  I'd rather go to Penn Brewery at the bottom of Troy Hill.",0
"The waiter was so rude! Super disappointed because years ago, this use to be my favorite sushi spot. Will not be coming back.",0
Racks full of costumes. The perfect place for Halloween accessories. They even had a sale rack. Which is good because most fully decked out costumes aren't cheap. Cool stuff for theme parties also.,0
"Not a great place. Food wasn't good and service kind of sucked! Told the waiter that the food was horrible and all he said was, \""So You're Done?\"". Will not go back!",0
Easy 5. Authentic old school ice cream parlor with PSU ice cream (peachy paterno etc). The ice cream soda was an outstanding ride in the wayback machine.,0
Food is bar food nothing great. But it is a good time. Karaoke was fun if you know your songs from the 70s and 80s. Fun crowd that just wants to sing and drink no drama,0
The double queen beds are great for a family of 4.  Nice and new hotel but hotel needs to hire more cleaning crew. The room was dusty and quite dirty.\n\nWill not stay again.,0
I love the beyooonnnnddddd section ;)\nI am seriously going to sneak into one of their beautiful bed displays and take a nap.,0
"Mmmm, so dericious! they are always so nice, quick & our dinner is always fast. Happy hour is amazing & affordable!",0
"Solid dogs, ESP if you are a dog fanatic. Gravy Fries are awesome. I have lunch here everyday I am in Pittsburgh. Much better than Franktuary.",0
I have been here before and I liked it. Not impressed this time. I ordered Chicken Benito. It was not prepared as explained in the menu and chicken overcooked. Nothing is worse than overcooked chicken.,0
If you like eight legged critters crawling around on our plate then you will love this place!  Three people came out and acknowledged this and still charged me full price!  Hope this this helps the future yelpers.,0
"Jenna gives the best salon hair. It took me over a year to find a great stylist, but she is a diamond in the rough. Environment is very friendly.",0
I like bottom but I like there older menu better. For example I miss the sausage meatloaf vs the new turkey one they replaced it with. Doesn't wow me like the other did. They lose a star with this updated menu.,0
"Fantastic food and service here. I ordered a combo plate with teriyaki beef and chicken. They were out of lumpia, so if you are looking for that call ahead as they said they run out quickly!",0
Excellent food and great that they can accommodate large parties the fries are so good you have to eat them all.,0
This is your store for all your home paint needs. This is the best paint you can buy for your house. Don't waste your time at the big box stores buying low quality paint.,0
