We went here to get some wings. I didn't like the wings that much it was ok,0
Grade: F\n\nEven the fantastic Crunch Coat Blizzard can't make up for the deep fried tumor passed off as a chicken breast.,0
"Decent Irish pub in downtown Phoenix...nothing exceptional about it, but good place to have a beer with friends!",0

I am sorry to say that this was literally the worst pizza I have ever eaten.,0
"Okay store, they don't offer double coupons, only at face value.  Only come here for eggs and milks.  Surprise that they are still in business!",0
"A dive bar with decent drink prices. Good for a conversation, bad for excitement. They do have a couple pool tables and an up to date Golden Tee machine.",0

Very clean theater with a very friendly staff. Average age of the customers is about 85 yo so try to avoid afternoon showings and go later at night when it's less crowded.,0
So-so pizza.  There's definitely better pies in town.,0
this restaurant is not wheelchair accessible. I have no idea how the food is because there are 2 steps and no ramp.,0
Stetson Chopped Salad. Enough Said.,0
Courtney does great waxing! Erica is an amazing manicurist!  Love these girls!,0
Good diner in a ghetto area - kinda like a diamond in the rough. Good food for a fair price.,0
Mother's Day brunch. Short rib and Salmon both expertly prepared and fabulous. Large chilled shrimp and crab claws fantastic. All good but way overpriced. Will look elsewhere going forward.,0
By far THE best cucumber martini around. Very light & fresh. The only thing that would make it better is if they would put a thin slice of cucumber on top instead of a wedge of lime.,0

This dentist is by far the worst I have ever been to. His manner is rude and if you won't get everything he recommends he does not seem to care. Just a mean man.,0

I love this place. The fried dumplings are to die for.,0

"if it helps, this place really smells like a bookstore.\neven from the street as you are walking by and their door is open.",0
"Was not a fan. The service was horrible, pork was chewy and they were out of mac n cheese. The only good thing was they had Big Red on the fountain. I will not return.",0
Meh.  They don't deliver to Swissvale.,0
"all i can say is, red robin, yum",0

Love this place! Shrimp cocktail so good. My hubby loves the camarones bucaneros. Great service and owners are super nice!,0

All you can eat menudo on sat and sun! But beware of the ghost! Manuel's is considered haunted from when it used to be a convenience store.... BOO!,0

Best massage I've had in the Valley...from Sierra! Will be back...,0
Perfect example of why this countries judicial system is a joke. These lawyers are a fine example of corruption as they make their money off of honest home owners and crooked HOA's. I suggest an honest lawyer look into their records and sue them.,0
I used to go down the street for Mineo's - but that was before I stopped in at Aiello's.  Try the white pizza - probably the best I've ever had (your experience may differ).,0

Salsa was fantastic!  I had the chicken tacos....the chicken was very salty...they were okay.,0
OMGthis pizza is the bomb that's all i gotta say!,0
Service wasn't that great. The prime rib has no flavor. The portions were smaller than you would get at a French restaurant. Dessert looked decent but it looked better than it tastes.,0
This used to be cool place with good food. Now sushimi with slice of lime is called ceviche....ahhh,0
"They close at 9pm with a 24 hour window after that.  So if you're hoping to pop in late just to say you did, check their hours first.",0
I don't know why I always shop around bc I know Pruitts will have the best price. I wish they had a better website.,0

had the rotisserie chicken last fall was very slimy and not as good as the fresh market in Cornelius which is great. The sides are not as good as they once were,0
I ordered a Caesar Salad to go.  Never have I a paid 9.00 for a worst salad. I was unaware the Greeks use brown old lettuce and Romaine,0
I always like this place. I don't think I have ever had a bad meal here.,0
"They lost stars due to allowing grown men use the \""FAMILY\"" dressing rooms to change and shower KNOWING that it's reserved for people with children under 17.  What does THAT tell you!",0
Tomato Sauce + Chicken Broth does not = Tomato Soup! \n\n- 1 star,0

"Great service but food was like from a camping trip - powdered eggs, microwaved sausage patty, and Eggo waffles - no lie!",0
wife drags me here I could do with out for sure,0
People honestly review airports? As if you have options? As if you honestly decide whether or not to visit a city because of it's airport? The fact this this has 800+ reviews blew my mind!,0
This is a good upper-mid range restaurant that has a good selection of food. I was very pleased with the calamari when I had it.,0
"They have great food, they also have roaches",0
"It isn't well known but each Manuel's is owned by one of the children of the original owner- the best one is on Peoria, that is one that you hear good things about.",0

I definitely learned alot about the south here. Really glad we spent a few hours here.  Makes you appreciate modern times.,0

Stay away from the sicilian unless your want a pound of bread...,0
This place made my first time having greek food a memorable experience.The greek chicken salad was delicious! Not only was the food tasty but the service was excellent. I will definitely be coming back!,0
We waited over an hour for a table. The hostesses were beyond rude. The food was ok but definitely not worth the wait. Don't waste your time!,0
"Coffee is good, atomshere is nice, can get  a little noisy, the back room is good for small meetings.",0
Steaks were awesome. Melt in your mouth. Better yet when we asked to sit in the dining room rather than the back room they went out of their way to accommodate us,0
"The food is awesome! The staff is average, dont be discouraged the food is worth it!",0
Staff is nice and the price is fair. Car condition is superior.,0
Tried it for the first time and the last time....over priced icky mushy food with extremely small portions. I called to inform them and got a very slight sorry,0
I will recommend this to anyone who wants a familiar taste and a break from big portioned Las Vegas food and buffet...,0
"If you want to be threaten this is the place to eat.  Horrible service, manager is extremely rude.",0

"We have eaten at Fleming's a number of times.The food is pretty good, but the service has sucked each time. We mentioned to the manager, whom was not very sincere with his response. Next time Eddie V's",0
I need to deduct another star for their use of styrofoam cups.  Green definitely it's not.,0
I went to the restaurant for dinner and ordered the sea bass.  It was delicious and it came with a side order of vegetables. I really like this place and will return in the future.,0

"I am in Love with their Original Fish Taco!  the service is Always friendly and attentive. Kudos to their fry cook, they fry and sauce those tacos with love, lol.",0
Probably the best Italian food I have had so far the in the valley. Our waiter was very friendly as well. This is more of a spot to bring your significant other then a group full of kids.,0

Great location - make sure you ask for a view of the river.  Worth the money.,0

I can't believe this place is in business. The food is worse than you find in the freezer section at Walmart.,0
"I always love Red Robin... Their crispy chicken salad is definitely my favorite, and their burgers will never, ever let you down. This particular location was alright-- large, clean, nice service, but nothing special.",0
"A \""neighborhood joint\"" that's closed on Sundays during football season???",0

great food...great value...gotta go early...usually busy!!!,0
Food was great!  Ribs were amazingly tender. Steak had great flavor. \nWait was long and they don't accommodate larger parties. Other then that... We really enjoyed it.,0
"It's an ok casino.  However it is not on the strip, so it will be quieter. Generally will see more locals than tourists here.  Always have seen friendly staff, and food has been good.",0
"My absolutely favorite dish is the potato gnocchi. Just amazing! Service is fantastic, nice decor. I wish they wouldn't use such huge paper towels in the bathroom, but other than that I really like this place.",0
It's a pretty good breakfast place. Kind of like Denny's and their service there is alright. It's more of a good rest stop type of diner than a family friendly diner.,0

"Still frustrated over missing prices on expensive meat products but I just received exemplary help from the new department manager,  Jovan, looks like there will be no more green meat here - yay!",0
"Like most food establishments in this part of Tempe, the price is right.  The sandwiches are pretty good too.  My one complaint is the lighting.  I'm not supposed to look green under any lighting.",0
Not so great... Salads are soggy and there is something about dirty bathrooms and really bad upholstery with the combination of swatting flies  away from your food that makes you want to run from that place.,0
"It's Denny's! friendly service, food was Meh? Nothing to write home about, my Bfast potatoes we hot and Ice cold... wanted to B**CH but just passed on eating them and left...",0
The attendants are nice when available. The playlist overhead made me want to leave. It is a horrible mix of country and pop.,0
"They were totally rude and when I asked if they can deliver the food 10 minutes earlier, they said no and hung up. Do not order from these people if you expect decent service.",0
Ok I can eat here and be full but nothing to write home about......,0

Lame. Don't believe the fat old bald guy out front that says it's illegal to use anything but their drivers. He's a liar. Use uber. It's cheaper.,0
"Just don't bother ordering anything if you're seated. Staff won't bother, either.",0
"Good food... opinion finely dice your Jalepenos in your cream cheese, slices of them yuk! It wasnt spicy either... add some of the seeds.",0
"awesome pizza. it's kind of tucked away. there's time when i'm craving Spinato's pizza, not just any pizza.",0
Food is always good never had bad food. Service is good for the most part its very seldom that it is not good. But everyone has a off day. Wish the prices were not so high.,0
"Steaks were really good, theres so much stuff too look at, and the views at night are spectacular!",0
I don't understand the negativity on some reviews of this place. It was super quick efficient and overall thorough. I recommend this place to anyone who is questionable.,0
Persian room special is a great value!!! $39.99,0
"Best soul food in Charlotte. Other than the clogged arteries, nothing to complain about. The cornbread is amazing by the way, probably the most memorable part of my meal.",0
DIVE BAR! \nI do not get the fascination for DIVE Bars,0
"upon entry it is immediately evident this is a 'pee anywhere' establishment, complete w/ pee pee scented pint glasses. stay away from the black & yellow.",0
My favorite bar. I moved away and it closed.\nSad,0
"Great selection, they have all the good stuff - even all natural brands.  It's difficult to resist the smell walking by.  Sometimes I've gotten free samples of their soap bars tucked inside my shopping bag.",0
Great service and atmosphere.  The food is good - comfort food for the soul.,0
the bread...the bread...the bread.  \n\neat it and be happy.,0
I went 12/24 at 4:30. It is small attractive with very nice people. The appetizer was excellent while the tea and main course were mediocre. First I am nothing close to an expert and this was my initial visit.,0
"Thanks for the service, or lack thereof. Customer service sucked. Not one person offered to help, and yes, it was slow.",0
"Yeah, it's cheap. But my shirts come back crunchy. Could be better, could be worse.",0
"Had wonderful dinner tonight,service was wonderful, over all  great time had by all",0
Best coffee I've ever tasted! Being able to watch them roast the beans right in front of me was pretty cool as well.,0
A litTle confusing when you check in in your mobile! The airport itself quite clean. Really like the layout. Traffic just flows thru there without a hitch.,0
My guests and I had a pleasant meal with good service.,0
Never been disappointed by the food at the roasting company. I would say they use high quality ingredients and it's always super tasty. Prices are reasonable for the quality! We go whenever we're in the SouthPark area.,0
"Very good soup for starters, place is packed so I can expect everything else to be good to.",0
"We LOVE hot bagel, the food is delicious. We will go on the weekend and get the bagel, egg, meat and cheese.  The bagels have a nice taste and are a change from the store bought type.",0
Ordered a Spanish latte. Zero foam and not hot enough. Not very good for its price. They were definitely rushing it.\nThe location is convenient though.,0
Ehhh I don't really like this place.,0
This place has a bigger dance room rather than other places.,0
Great stay.  Spa treatment was outstanding.  Staff all around was so focused on serving.  Always a friendly hello from everyone there.  Stayed 5 days but wish it could have been 5 months!,0
Sesame Inn has 4 locations. Station Square is the worst of all. I generally avoid this one but love the other 3. Still much better than most Chinese around town.,0
Really? Not very coupon friendly. Moved to cvs.,0
"Came here for brunch and wasn't impressed with the selection on the menu, ordered the scrambled eggs which were OK.  I will go back to try dinner at some point but I am not in a rush.",0
"Food is terrific. Service is laid back but responsive. Definitely recommended. Would be 5 stars, but it's a bit spendy.",0
Excellent juicy (not greasy) carne asada tacos. You know it's the real deal when it has only cilantro and onion! The salsas are also excellent,0
"Great service from the Bartenders, well priced drinks, music is good and theme nights are fun. Check this bar out. This was back from Jan 2013. was in town for softball tournament.",0
The food there was okay. I had a salmon dish there. I don't eat beef so I can speak for their steak.,0
This was a cool dive bar.. too bad we got there in time for only round before they closed.. fun crowd!,0
Turkey dish I ordered was on the salty side and really nothing to write home about. I won't be back.,0
Friendly service. Just doesn't compare to dim sum in Cali.,0
They do excellent pedicures and I enjoyed the stones they rub on your leg and feet towards the ending of your pedi. Very friendly staff.,0
"I want to like it. I really do. I've been twice, but each time I found the dishes bland... or with a spiciness that was just spice, not flavor.",0
"I've never had anything that wasn't absolutly delicious! Great Italian food and if you are in the mood to cook, they have it all for a perfect Italian meal! Try the take out to impress your next dinner party!!",0
A $13 steak as good as some $50 steaks I've had.,0
"here's a tip - they don't stock their shelves, so what's on display they might not have, and they often have discontinued items on display. lame.",0
I would have ordered from this place again if the driver hadn't of scammed me for an extra dollar.  Look at your receipt!,0
Good size margaritas with plenty of alcohol for $3.99 during happy hour!!! Doesn't get better than that...,0
Really upset\nThey would not honor my coupon-- come on we all use them. Don't you want my business??never again,0
Desert was great - beer was good.  Food was under seasoned a bit with out the sauce.  Husband liked it with.,0
Horrible - they use chicken that's been out uncover all day. And they smoke around the food.:(,0
"Its what you expect, hot wings, beer, sports nothing to write home about but not bad either.",0
This would be the chinese hang out. The food quality and price are the reasonable but the service is so- so.,0
"Nice place, very rustic and southwestern. The prime rib was very tender and tasted great. The service could be a little quicker, but other than that its an outstanding family restaurant.",0
Lived here for 6 yrs and never tried this place. That was a big mistake ad this place is great. We will definitely be back!,0
"Vartan what can you say about him that hasn't been said. A true gentleman, a humble man, a generous man... hospitality is A++++ at Ambassador. Make time to burn",0
"First time here. Great little place. Nice, but not to fancy. Great food and atmosphere.  Would recommend!",0
Got sick eating at Claim Jumper in the Casino.  Then woke up to beetles in bed with me.  The only cool thing was the pool.,0
The architecture was gorgeous. Building is quite pretty and modern. I can't help but feel that there isn't much to see inside though. There were nice exhibits but it could have been a lot better if they added more substance.,0
"Awesome place to go. Their motto says it all, \""little place, big flavors\"" or something like that. It's just really really good.",0
Everyone out there do not order from this place it is horrible disgusting and spoiled food Go Go China is horrible horrible horrible and they will not even give my refund back and didn't even eat my food  they shouldn't even stand in business,0
"Good selection of... Anything and everything. Other than that, this place is awful. The staff are rude, they don't know what they are doing, the prices aren't better than anywhere else. They suck.",0
The best Italian delivery! Large portions and always good. Super fast delivery and staff excellent at handling orders. Salads are fresh. Which is hard to find in a restaurant that delivers.,0
As usual food and service is great! Our 16 yr old son could not even finish the eye opener!  The portions are huge and the quality doesn't waiver!  Enjoy!!,0
Great food and service. Wine prices are reasonable and they have some very good wine available. Owners are always onsite and available to say hello and just check that all is well. Music a few nights a week but same guy all the time.,0
"These bagels are fine, but I think their drinks are yummy. I like the blackberry lemonade. \n\nThe interior is sterile, but air conditioned with clean bathrooms and on state street that is saying a lot.",0
"So i have been there a half a dozen times, and this time the food was just OK. Times before it was fantastic. They are definitely not the most polite people in the world, but the food is 'usually.'",0
Food was delicious. I had the meatloaf and the brown tomato gravy on top was fantastic. Hubby had the Catfish and said it was great. Large portions...we didn't finish. Server was very attentive.,0
Overpriced. The the stars are for the comedian...not the establishment,0
"The service at Mr. Roberts is okay, but the free live music is what pulls me in! Drinks are reasonably priced too.",0
"This was my go to Chinese place in Charlotte.  As others have said, it's quick and inexpensive.  And don't forget tasty!!",0
i don't know what to say their double chicken bowl deal is delicious! you get a lot of food here for your money i think plus the salsa bar is pretty dang good itself!!!.,0
Very disappointing. Not traditional Chinese food. Not worth the money.,0
I did not try their food but I went in to get an ice tea. It was almost $3 and so old that I took half a sip and dumped it out. Nothing worse than terribly old ice tea!,0
Maybe it's the broken wrist doing the reviewing but this place has way too many unattended children to be deemed safe.,0
They are crooks & bamboozled me for a meal that I did not even enjoy! Beware of their pricing and I will never eat there again!,0
Great bar. Friendly staff and amazing prices. Wish they served food other wise perfect place to hang out at and play all the bar games you can think.,0
"I've actually never been here for lunch, but hear good things. The breakfast items are good though, for sure.",0
If you don't know about Dillard's then I'm not telling you!,0
One of my favorite cheesy downtown Vegas hotels... \n\nNothing fancy. But i like it alot. NICE friendly employees and a bomb Hawaiian restaurant upstairs. Keeping it real here. lots of locals,0
Always good service and friendly but it tends to take a little longer than I like to be done,0
"Such a cute place. Went with my dad for lunch and the service was great, the food was decent and the desert was out of this world! Good place for a meal with parents, date or something where classy and tidy are desired.",0
Much better than streets of New York and there wings are the best I go there all the time,0
"Tasty salsa on the salsa bar that was appreciated, because the chicken was very dry.",0
Amazing staff and great wine selection!  One of my favorite places to relax on any night. Live music on Friday an Saturday!,0
"You better ask for the things you would normally would expect from any other location,  napkins, fork,  straw, cocktail sauce.",0
"Not exactly French food, but very satisfying.  Huge meatballs and a seriously tasty burger for a fair price will have my friends and I return.",0
this subway somehow always makes me sick. i suggest not ordering anything there and making a sandwich at home.,0
Terrible terrible food. Flavors were over powering and clashed. I had two bites. Son had a few bites. Husband had a few also. We all ordered different food and it was all disgusting.,0
"This branch has a very unprofessional staff. My spouse & I are both going to switch banks due to very poor customer service!! Tellers are rude, very young, do not care about the customer at all.",0
"The atmosphere outside on the patio is nice, but the food wasn't more than mediocre at best. Good service.",0
"I was here last night for the Mosaik ballet.  Gotta love this old, nicely restored theatre.  It's a classic and I enjoy attending performances here every time.",0
"Divey hole-in-the-wall, but Salem's has the best damn gyro in the city!  I stumbled upon it after my dad turned me on to this place and...  so good!",0
"I love Spa Lamar! The service is amazng, the packages are incredibly reasonable.",0
Why are the prices increasing as the competition disappears. Ever since circuit city went under the prices went up drastically. I also don't like when the push the extended warranties.,0
As always great service and lots of fun its a tad expensive for fondue but its worth it especially for special occasions,0
"Fun little treasure trove of collectibles, gifts and oddities.  Fun way to spend a few hours.",0
"Just proving I'm not a foodie snob ;) well it's cheap, effective and comes with free packets of ketchup. Enjoy!",0
"Went back today and had some really good food.  The zucchini is extremely good, on par with any others I have had in the valley.",0
"I found a thin rope in my donut!!! Not very clean, I would say!",0
This is a great pizza place!! The pizza is really fresh and tastes amazing! The price is really reasonable too!,0
They have lost clothing on me twice and I still have not received a call or follow up on an article of clothing they lost.  Should have come on here first!,0
"We visited due to its proximity. Wow! Great, convenient, local Mexican food. You know it's good if the local fire station is at the table next to you enjoying their food.",0
Went to the nini nails on John Delany and got the worst pedicure ever staff was rude and my nails look like crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
A REAL hardware store with employees who actually know what's what!!! Such a refreshing change from the big-box stores who's employees have no idea what you're talking about. :^),0
Starbucks is Starbucks is Starbucks. If it wasn't like $9 for a muffin and a smoothie I'd go here more often.,0
"I liked the food, the comedians, the look of the place...but it smelled horrible, like stale beer and garbage and gross feet. The smell was really distracting :(",0
"Interior design is nice. Had the pho and so far this is the best place for pho, except for at home.",0
Amazing staff and doctor.  I've been seeing Dr. Larsen for years and trust his diagnosis.,0
"This place is the new Chop & Wok.  Good old fashioned, down and dirty chinese take out.  The owner is right out of a Seinfeld episode and it's worth eating there just to watch him run the show.",0
"food not hot, no flavor. people were nice.",0
Some prices you can't beat! All other prices... You can! Lol,0
"Out of the apple cinnamon bagels, when asked if they would bake more, they said \""not today\"".",0
Good but not great. Ordered the fruit cakes & they were totally uninspired.\n\nNot so many breakfast places in champaign so it is what it is.,0
The service is good with very high internet speeds. Cable TV is high quality also. The prices however are RIDICULOUS.....the price HIKES all the time make me want to lose my lunch,0
They make smoothies.  Can a smoothie ever be bad?,0
"Melt-in-your-mouth food...and close to my office! Bring cash, though...no plastic!",0
Good pizza and i love the breadsticks...i don't know too much else about this place,0
NEEDS BETTER FOOD!!! Even Oakland upgraded... get with it Phoenix!!!,0
"ate a salad here and half a turkey sandwich.  later became violently ill, will never eat here again!",0
"local, friendly businesses serving a great product DO still exist.",0
Cool Irish spot with a new outdoor patio. No food and a limited draft and bottled beer selection.  Free WiFi.  The hostess is gorgeous so I would drink there anytime.,0
"went back there today and asked for two simple burgers with nothing but ketchup and cheese, not hard, right? apparently it is if your english is as good as your order taking skills",0
Excellent food and service.For a great steak you sure can't beat the road house. \nAnd the service is also great every time I come here.,0
I come in every 2 weeks. I swear it's a 30 minute wait ever single time. Always a long line here.,0
Has needs - trash cans - benches - amphitheatre,0
"Looking for a non commercial place too get wings while visiting Vegas, a server at our hotel recommend this place. Wings were good, crispy, not that frozen packed your texture..sauce was good though I like a little more heat",0
"Mom loved the place! It was another great experience visually and food was delicious as usual! Must come and dine, its a western experience you don't want to miss.",0

"Ate here for the first time, very impressed, let the chef chose and we were very pleased with the taste, selection and presentation.  Will be back!",0
I just read that this place was temporarily shut down by health inspectors for scoring -9 out of 100 on their inspection.  Disgusting!,0
"I must say with respect for the Thai culture, this resturaunt did slightly impress me with one of their chicken curry dishes, service was pleasant, and I do believe I shall return.",0
The kids the have working at this location don't give a shit about you or your food screw this place. One of them looked all tweeked out. No go!,0
Decent food at decent prices.  I wasn't blown away by this place.  I was somewhat disappointed since I heard this is one of the better places in town to have breakfast - I have definitely had better elsewhere!,0
Pretty good food at an acceptable price. They seem to have a good beer selection too. The server was very friendly and responsive. Good place.,0
Prices have gone through the roof! I was quoted $350 and then I was handed a $570 bill.,0
"This place is simply amazing,\nWe eat there at least once a week,For many years.\nDefinitely a place to go for people who appreciate good food and service.",0
Thats not BBQ...its meat with BBQ sauce :(((,0
Really an enjoyable Macy's. not too big but has all your needs. Customer service is also good!,0
Absolutely the best Rueben I've had anywhere - and I eat the Rueben almost every time it's on anyone's menu.  Nice array of draught beers.  The place is also very reasonably priced.,0
I went to this office today with my children to get glassesfor them.the staff and the doctors were very friendly and helpful. i highly recomend this wonderful office.,0
"Bumping up my stars because I have recently found out that they use a soy sauce in their sauces that is gluten free! Feast away, my fellow gluten intolerants and celiacs!",0
Wonderful food! Excellent service! Great lunchtime atmosphere!,0
We walked in and the manager looked at us three times and walked away. This place is awful. Go elsewhere.,0
Love this place they always get remember me and my order :),0
The service here is extraordinary - over the top. I stay here regularly. They really make an effort to satisfy guests.,0
"I've loved this place for years.  It's typical of chop suey houses in other major cities; authentic, perhaps short on style but absolutely outstanding food.  Great people.",0
Foul tasting chicken. I don't know what else could make me so sad.,0
"Ever since Dominos changed up their recipe/ingredients, their pizza has really been awesome. I enjoy the thin crust with spinach, tomatoes, and mushrooms.  Mmmm",0
Great food! I loved the Tangerine Chicken! :),0
Garbage is the only nice word that comes to mind,0
"The contemporary and American art sections of this museum are 5 stars, outstanding! I also loved the overall museum layout and architecture.",0

"Very good tamales. Very large, beautifully appointed building. That said, you will get better atmosphere, service, and, not surprisingly, better tamales in the parking lot of el Super.",0
Best sushi on the west side! Love it and eat there 3-4 times per week! Fresh and great quality...order the First Love Roll!,0
"Went to dinner tonight and got horrible service, nothing worse than serving you a semi-warm overpriced beer in a warm glass. Food was ok way overpriced.",0
"Absolute GARBAGE! The service sucks, the food wouldn't interest you dog, and the place is a mess. I won't be back",0
I loved the cake--and the quiche--and the soups (French onion was great!)--and the friendly personal service--and the rubber stamp store next door!  Hope to see them again soon!,0
Not a bad place to go but not my first choice. The food is good but nothing unique or special.,0
This place used to be so great. Not anymore... Terrible the last 3 times I've been in! So sad.,0
This was the most disturbingly bland meal. Yuck.,0
Great local yarn store with lots of high-quality yarns of many different varieties.  The cafe in back is nice and cozy too.,0
Censored art. The board  for this club wants dumbed down art that doesn't offend their sensibilities. But....just butt.,0
"Get doughnuts from the QT up the street, they are fresher, cheaper, and faster.",0
"It is a nice  store, but not enough employees to service the busy times.",0
The pizza was good but it is so dirty and all of the tables are shaky.  Terrible atmosphere.  I like a dive if it has character- this place is just gross.,0
It's been 2 years and that plug is still holding fine through three oil changes. Not a drop of oil spilled.,0
"Always my favorite place to go to breakfast on Sunday, there is always a line but the wait is usually short. Can't beat the home style cooking and fast friendly service. Biscuits and gravy just Like my mom made em.",0
Fabulous crab cakes and oysters.  Thus place feels like dining in a tree house with rock'n music. The patio is fun and casual.,0

I ordered the center-cut ribeye for entree. It was delicious. \nThe environment is nice and servers are polite. Recommended.,0
"Gross! I ordered a turkey sandwich. Just awful. The bread was falling apart and hard, the meat tasted terrible, like plain ol' lunch meat. Overpriced and definitely not worth it. Don't waste your time or money!",0
The food was excellent.  Nice selection of food.  I truly enjoyed the atmosphere.   Additionally the staff were very polite and around frequently enough to provide great service.,0
"Popular place with the locals.  My relatives and I go to Sam's town about once a month.  Mostly play keno.  Last time we were there, my sister in law won $60,000 at keno!",0
Ok crowd. Good place to see concerts. But stupid expensive drinks and the bartenders do not give very good service. I've downgraded this place to only a concert stop. And only then if there is nothing else going on.,0
"Feels a slight bit pricey, but overall tasty food and very friendly service. That about sums it up I think. Not remarkable, but definitely good enough.",0
Older theatre but it still does the job! It's got a lot of character to it and sometimes you can see a pretty decent concert there!,0
"Great, fun atmosphere, and good food! What more could you ask for?!",0
Breakfast at 2:30....  Holla!,0
"Fantastic food, especially the fresh lobster with scallions and ginger. Very friendly staff and owners. Go there weekly.",0

"We come here for pies and they do not disappoint. Have had lunch here once or twice, and it is OK, but it is the pies that make the trip. I recommend the mixed berry or the coconut cream.",0
"this place has gone down hill, everything taste bland, go to archies instead. it is worth the drive",0
I didn't even want to go. I was so wrong! Best place I ate in Vegas.,0
Have a great happy hour. Good food and beer. Enjoyed myself. Great stop for sushi. Try it out if you get a chance.,0

"Omg, the food here taste like it was prepared in a dirty toilet. That's a compliment compared to what I would like to say about the food.",0
"The house soup and house salad were great. I didn't try the pasta which I think is good. Do NOT order \""Lobster&Shrimp Rivioli\"" because it tastes like microwave food.",0
This is a good lounge that is off the beaten path. The atmosphere is good here. I had a few drinks and ate the food. The drinks where great and the food was good. The service was good and the food came out fast.,0
Manager there has no people skills very rude and unprofessional. Will never shop there again.,0
Maybe a step down from Mineos Pizza which is not that great either. I agree with yelpers who identify a sweet taste. How do Mineos and Aiello's have such good reputations? It is a mystery to me?,0
"Excellent service, great food. Nachitos came out and made me laugh, as the name implies that they are small. They are not. Great fajitas too.",0
"I always come here when we they have crawfish in season. But all of their other dishes are great too. Tonight the service was a little off, but all in all dinner was still great as always.",0
Probably the worst run business I have ever dealt with in my entire life.,0
"Great food, but maybe they didn't have enough staff to accommodate the amount of guests.",0
"Overrated, ok service, very bland food.",0

Great place to go for a cheap date. Wonderful priced tickets and concession prices are even lower than AMC and Harkins. I love it and would recommend it to anyone!!,0
"Great food, great prices and great service... gotta come back for the fish fry friday...",0
Best PHO in Arizona!! Amazing spring rolls as we'll. please take the time to try this place:),0
I always remark to myself about the professional demeanor of the people who work here.\nWalt runs a tight ship.,0
Had the Nova Lox and bagel...really fresh and tastey...great pickle too...Alsomy friend had the spanish omlette all veggies...fresh...will be back for soe of the soups...tastey,0
"This place was horrible!  The pizza was so bad I had to spit it out... I also ordered the chopped salad, not only was the salad chopped to nothing, the balsamic dressing was not good.",0
"The soup wasn't bad, but the guy who was serving it was really creepy and totally ruined the entire experience. Plus, they were out of my first and second choices even though they were supposed to be open for 2 more hours.",0
"I usually love this place, but I just ordered 20 wings and not only did it take way longer than I was told, but there are 20 drumsticks and that's it. All drumsticks! Who does that!?",0
"Flowers stunk to high heaven with all the chemicals they sprayed on them to try to make dead flowers look fresh. It didn't work, they looked like dead flowers. Absolutely the worst bouquet I've ever bought. Don't bother.",0
"Not sure what happened but the beans were watery and had ZERO flavor, the tacos were not crispy at all and the carne asada was bland... First time in YEARS we had bad food here. I hope they recover.",0

This place has NEVER gotten our order right.  Not once.  Lame.,0
Awesome fries green tomatoes and shrimp and grits! The appetizers make a great lunch!,0

"This place is a disaster!  The restaurant was dirty, they ran out of lobster, the manager was a total jerk...  I can't think of a single good thing to say about this place.",0
"Its probably as authentic of a New York (city) style pizza as you will find at 5'oclock in the morning in a place like Tempe that is made by Chaldeans. Floppy, greasy, goodness.",0
"The service was great, I love my server!",0
"Put it this way: Every guest I have in Phoenix, I force to get the Monte Cristo at Morning Glory. It is just that good.",0
Horrible food not child friendly horrible waiter. I understand it's the oldest restaurant but it stinks not coming again,0
A little overpriced but the bagels are always good and fresh. The cinnamon French toast (made from their cinnamon log bread) is also very good!,0
My wife had the turkey sandwich and it was way too dry. My Dad had the turkey cranberry and there were bones in it. I had the meatball and it was actually pretty good.,0
Excellent palace for all local stuff...really diverse wine grouping with wine you can't find most places in Phoenix.,0
This place is NOT GOOD. DO NOT EAT HERE! It's the worst place ever!,0
"Walked in with a massive hangover, shot of Jameson, a beer, and a patty melt....walked out feeling like a million bucks.....THANKS",0
Great office! The office consists of very dedicated staff members that love their job-and it shows. Both dentists on board take great care of their patients. they take the time to know the individual and tailors to each persons needs.,0
Will never come to this place again. Don't even bother doing punch cards because the old lady will find an excuse to say is not valid.,0
"Great room - terrific pool & hot tub. Very accommodating staff. Beautiful locale. Quiet & peaceful, yet close to Scottsdale.",0
The food here is okay...\nbut the service here is horrible.\nI would not recommend this place at all!!,0
"Solid hotel, pretty hard beds but clean. Great water pressure and fantastic location.  Be sure to join their club for free in room wifi.",0
Sometimes I get lucky and find something. But personally I never find anything at any of these thrift shops but friends I go with always find something good.,0
"This place is absolutely amazing. The bean and cheese burrito, chicken nachos, and chicken salad is so good. Totally come to this place all the time :)",0
This airport is huge. So big that I would never want to transfer flights here with different airlines because I don't know if I would make it in time. Big plus that there is free wifi and decent food options,0
"You can't go wrong with Pho Kim Long. Morning, noon, or all night! Quality food, fast service, and friendly environment.  Order anything. It'll be above average.",0
"Very old place and you can't even get a drink at a decent price, we paid $8 a Stella Artois...On Tap! BS! Don't bother going.",0
The get me my coffee AND it's a surprisingly clean restaurant. \n\nCan't be a $1.08 cup of joe.,0
Will not be doing any business with them if I can help it.  Was just cold called about their 'exciting plans' to my cell phone.,0
"awful, food is bad and there is nogood service.",0
"For a quick bite to eat this is the place, it is inexpensive and filling. The staff is always super nice, and food is always good. Cant go wrong just wish they would open one in Surprise.",0
Have adopted 2 cats from here. The staff is very friendly & helpful. The cats were healthy and playful. Very clean & sanitary.,0
"normally the food and service are great, but Sunday the food and service was cold - what's up with this?",0
"Better than most, not as good as the best. Just an avegage wash. Good news, I will be back though. Good enough for that",0
Summer hours... Open at noon!  WTF!,0
Brought the entire family tonight to taste the goodness! Ordered multiple crazy roller coaster rolls. Love the tuna and salmon sashimi.,0
"Food is delicious, good prices and nice people. Perfect combination...",0
Best brewery food in the valley- pumpkin porter is awesome- good consistent food- lots of tvs for watching sports!,0
This is where I am going from now on to get tires. It was fast cheap and the service was good. Plus they have a great deal on covering your tires. Way better than big o tires,0
Great staff and they're more than willing to make any customized drink at your request.,0
"The worst!  35 minutes just to leave the damn airport!  Bad product, bad attitude, stay away.",0
"It's not delivery, it's digiorno...\n\nyou'll be better off",0
Love this place. Not fancy but the ladies know what they are doing,0
"Not bad.  Not great.  But not bad.   Excellent bang for your buck, especially if you're hungry.",0
"The wings are the best of all I've had. Gets rather noisy when kids are, but there is also a bar area where they don't usually go. All in all I like the place. Menu keeps improving.",0
"There extremely slow, and it's cold bring a jacket!  Make an appointment if you can.",0
"love this place, we always have a great time!",0
"The facility is very nice and clean and all the staff is so very nice, this is my favorite hospital in las Vegas",0
"Have purchased trees here,tagged them,only to have them sold out from under me later.  Won't go there again, no matter how good the staff is. Miss the old owners. Kids don't count.",0
The best. Love the furniture and the helpful  salesperson.  Very knowledgable.,0
"The best Mexican food in Chandler.  Our church group started having taco nights here a few years ago, and they are so nice.  El Presidente Burrito is the best thing on the menu!!",0
I just had the worst Chi Tea Latte ever.  It was made from a powder.  It didn't taste anything like chi.  It was like drinking milk with a lot of sugar.,0
"Ick, Sorry, I did give you 2 stars for politeness.  Food was awful!!",0
Horrible management 30 minute waits on each hole because they cannot hire a starter who can do a mediocre job of managing a 27 hole course.,0
It is sooooo cold in the dining room... its cold enough outside... for crying out lout turn up the heat!!!!,0
Worse service ever... Waited over an hour n half for pizza.. Manager argued and was unconcerned with my order. Only thing missing from being the worst services possible is spit in my food and not putting that past them.,0
The most arrogant and pretentious staff of any Home Depot I have ever encountered. It is well worth going to Route by magnitudes of infinity.,0
"I ordered bagel with strawberry, they put almond.... If you ordered bagel thing they give you regular bagel???? What happened?",0
Coworker found this restaurant on Yelp. The Belgium Waffle was overcooked yet the batter was very tasty. The waitstaff was definitely the most enjoyable part of this restaurant.,0
"Their horchata tastes like caca. That is all I can say about this establishment. It tastes like melted vanilla ice cream with cinnamon, rather than a delicious refreshing Mexican drink. Will never order again.",0
Great food & super friendly staff! Older hotel but clean & well kept! A historic gambling site for those who want the old school style treatment.,0
Very good service and food. Very clean inside. Was greeted with a smile. Food came out hot and in a timely fashion.,0
"Arrived and waited for 10 minutes before I grabbed a menu and asked an employee if the guests were supposed to seat themselves.. He responded \""You can\"" and walked by with out furthering assisting me.",0
"Oddly smells like popcorn..but in that \""covering up a smell\"" bad way.",0
"Good for a breakfast with little kids, but otherwise not worth going to.",0
The burger and fries are nothing special....but not bad.  Be prepared for patties cooked in old grease.  The fries taste like frozen pre-packaged from sams club.\n\nParking is scarce.,0
"Double check your Togo order because they did not put anything I have requested in my Togo order. Not enough of sauce, wrong butter, and gave me the wrong shrimp.",0
I read all of the reviews and while in Phoenix decided to go to this establishment. Was really excited by the menu.........the service was horrible.....food took forever! Will not return.,0
"Don't get me wrong, this IS a college bar but the food is great and inexpensive. Excellent mozzarella sticks! Awesome sliders! Yummy wings! Bueno nachos! Tasty fries!",0
"If you like the kind of \""family\"" Mexican that is served in a million different Mexican restaurants this is the place for you. The chips and salsa are fresh and the fajitas are hot. Its just ok.",0
I got so sick and was throwing up after eating there! I have never been back since. And normally I never get sick to my stomach. I don't trust their food. And it is so overprized and overrated.,0
"The food and drinks are blah, but the service is always great! Happy hour and trivia are always fun at Skip & Jan's.",0
"Staff is always nice, food is always hot and cooked well.",0
"Not really a sushi place. More like a sports bar. They are the kings of spicy imitation crab. It's everywhere, on everything. Even just laying around the plate for \""presentation\"". This is our last visit.",0
"As of 9/28/14, the Happy Hour prices have now doubled.\nDrinks during 10-11 AM and 5-7 PM are now 2.00 plus tip",0
"When I want to gorge myself on salad, breads, and pizza, this is where I go. Delicious.",0
"Old Country Buffet is above average as far as American buffets go. If you're in the mood for it, it's pretty tasty.",0
Mmm one of my favorite places to go! I love almost everything on their menu and it is all very affordable :),0
The food here is very good but the snotty hostesses are rude I waited 10 minutes to give our name because they wee busy talking to guys. Never coming to this location again,0
We tried the prime rib tonight. Very Yummy.,0
the drinks here are soooo good. as for the food.....eh,0
They leave the roll up door between the bar and the smoking patio wide open so you can enjoy the cigarette smoke while you eat.,0
I went there last night for dinner and they closed the place down!!!  I am devastated!  I loved Furr's...,0
"Sweet, for an ice cream treat, nothing special but my daughter loves the ice cream and the service, she got free sprinkles. LOL... a ok with me! ;-)",0
There were bubbles of soap shining on the tops of my various side dishes so I couldn't even eat my lunch.,0
I swear I think they tried to poison me my drink was sour and tasted like something rotting the next morning I went to pour the soda down the drain and it reeked of something awful. I can't go back after that.,0
"So many beer options, decent food, and pint night for $3 on Monday.",0
"So, we ordered 6 pizzas tonight for my son's b-day party. They got 2 pizzas wrong. We went back to complain and got attitude from them and no apologies.\nAre we ever going back? Nope.",0
Had some great breakfast service. Spacious. Good pricing. Clean.,0
I have eaten here twice once for breakfast and once for lunch. And both times I have enjoyed the food that was made to order and the fast service. Big bonus is that Starbucks is next door. Yay!,0
Place just opened for the day and the restrooms by the food court are already disgusting and the housekeepers are just standing in the food court texting and looking stuff up on their phones while talking to each other.,0
"Easy in, easy out. Friendly staff that got the drinks out quickly. Lounge was clean. Seems a little odd that there is a Starbucks nearly right next door, just across the parking lot, in the grocery store. Plenty of parking.",0
My daughter chose this restaurant for her birthday dinner. We were very pleased with the experience. The waiter was helpful and efficient. I find it overpriced so I would save this place for special occasions only. Or when someone else is paying.,0
"The staff here are all friendly and professional my favorite stylist is Chanelle she's amazing and very talented,  I recommend you go in and see her. Salon is very clean.",0
Great food and service. Very happy with my visit.,0
This store is great... It's clean and all the employees are friendly,0
"the sandwich was amazing....but defintiely not worth $9. I've definitely had better.  It didn't even come with a side. great location and outdoor seating, but overrated.",0
"Got some caps that saved our faces in Utah, but go here for good show and local advice! Very friendly crew. Wished we would have done that sooner...",0
Decent place and people but a little run down.,0
"Glad to have this restaurant in my neighborhood, the only thing that would make it better for me would be a patio, you know for the dog to come with. Reasonable price, had a great red curry!",0
"Wait is too long (during Spring Training) and the food is just ok.  It's nostalgic, so I'll keep going, but not super impressed.",0
"HORRIBLE FOOD. My chicken sandwich tasted like rubber, the curly fries weren't cooked enough, and the wings were mediocre. \n\nStop supporting horrible chains like this and they will all go away.",0
"LOVE the Sizzling enchiladas!!! This hard to find location is so good, best Tex-Mex style I have found in the area. My family loves this place!",0
Really creative sushi and you gotta love a place that has the bento box.,0
Incredibly rude staff and the food is nothing special.  I definitely do not recommend this place.,0
"Good food but pricey. No salad with entry, just cold bread. Very large portions",0
Worst pasta ive ever experienced in my life. 20+ bucks and it was dried up pasta with tomato sauce. Garlic bread was decent so i gave it 2 stars.,0
Great bar food and atmosphere. I usually get the grilled buffalo chicken wrap. They have good beer specials and a unique crowd. Only problem I have is with the salad options.,0
"Love this place, they are good about describing the different kinds of sushi if you wanna try something different.  any time we have company we go here for your sushi.",0
Absolutely love their brisket sandwich!\nNothing compares to this sandwich. But I wish they were open until later for those late night cravings!,0
Meh.  \nThat's about as much enthusiasm as I can muster for this place...,0
They raised all of their prices August 1st. Go to brunswick its worth the money.,0
The food is pretty good - they have a great burger - however my girlfriend found a twist tie in her food so she'll never go back.,0
This is a filthy place.  Several times I saw cockroaches crawling around.  The service is terrible.  Only thing I like is their barbecue items.  Now I don't even go there because Mekong has better barbecue.,0
Dive bar filled with perverts and heroin addicts. Looks like an Intervention Convention. Bartenders are weathered and bitter. Food tastes bad and they charge way too much considering they are a dive bar and not a nightclub.,0
The scheduling staff and management are very rude. The aptitude of the dentist does not make up for the rude staff. I will never return.,0
It's an airport with sand sculpture animals. Oh and slot machines you know for when you can't wait to get to the casino and want to throw your money away first thing :),0
"Ate here today\nI hope that there is something better in Scottsdale\nNot that it was bad, but nothing special from the service to the food\nI'd say Skip It!",0
"1.5 / 5 - Beef Pho: Kind of bland tasting\n2.0 / 5 - Pork Chop: Not much meat and as much flavor as I'm used to, but still good.",0
The food here is soooooooo FUCKN GROSS NOW!!! Don't eat here... The chef SUCKX,0
Dr Trichak is the best dentist I've ever seen I will refer him to everyone I know very proud to have him as my dentist. Once you see him you'll never go to anyone else.,0
So horrible. Worst service and a shit hole. Dirty and slobs all over. Rudest staff I have ever seen.,0
"Good news - my sister got the flowers and she sent me a pic from her phone.  They're gorgeous!  And they arrived just in time, too!\n\nThanks, Cactus Flowers!! =)",0
Everything about this hotel was top notch! The service truly was outstanding and there to please any way possible. Thank you for [providing everyone of our requests and making our stay very memorable,0
"Great crust, sauce is pretty sweet, cheese is not the greatest. Overall just an ok pizza.",0
Nice to find a dead fly on the bed after checking in! Nicely done.,0
Great soup and Shrimp caprice. The only reason why I go there.,0
Go here for Uncorked. They are free wine tastings at Thursday at 5pm. There are usually shows you can sit and enjoy some of the wine and even some complementary cheese and crackers.,0
Nice and quiet hotel off the main road a lot of people miss if they not paying attention. Very clean and nice staff.,0
"Usually they have amazing pizza, but today it was room temperature and below average.",0
Solid stadium and the higher seats have a surprisingly good view. The video is great and the sound is decent and a Panthers win always makes the experience much more memorable.,0
Just beautiful! Service is excellent rooms are beautiful. Food is great also! Thankyou! :),0
"I love the bagels here. They are tasty and always taste fresh. I would eat here for breakfast every weekend if I could! \n\nHowever, some locations are better than others- they are not always consistent.",0
"Great location in Verona!  The bar is beautiful and they pour a large glass of wine for a good price.  Food is marginal at best, but not consistent.  The only thing I enjoy eating is the cheese bread.",0
"Baked apple pancake was horrible... Not worth the wait. Nothing was fresh ..,no flavor",0
Waiter was awful and food (pad thai) was not much better. Apparently letting the waiter know that your soda is flat (twice) is a huge inconvenience to him.,0
"memorable food moment:\nbacon wrapped mochi on a stick, grilled to perfection\n\ntakoyaki - close to perfection",0
"Really enjoyed my Gyro for lunch today. The family run restaurant is fun, positive, friendly and yummy!",0
Its ok.... Its ASU and kids dont really know where the good sushi is. Well its not in AZ lol. \n\nIts descent prices are way too high,0
"The food was delivered fast and it wasn't bad.  Unfortunately, it wasn't what I ordered and the staff seemed more interested in getting things done quickly that correctly.",0
I like this place.  They have fat free frozen yogurt in pistachio which is amazing.,0
"Consigned some items, got a check and picked up what didn't sell.  Easy!",0
This pizza is a step up from dominos!!! Who ever is putting 4 stars up don't know what good pizza is!!!,0
I don't often go with my boys to the strip clubs nearer downtown and this place is why! Horrible and smelled really bad. There was one nice girl there n wish I could remember her name. The 2 stars are for her!,0
"the buffet, you, must...go to it...nurrrrrr, AMAZING!",0
They used to have some awesome Tortas on the menu but they sometimes have the bread if you ask they can make them.  I really like the fish tacos omnomnom,0
"Great food even better ambiance. If the menu was more diverse, especially the dessert portion, this review would be even better. Will be coming back to Bandera again for sure.",0
"Excellent food, expensive beer... $6 for a southern tier dipa",0
"I'm not a fan of watered down vinegar sauce with a few specs of tomato at all.  I gave it two-stars just not to be a jerk, but I tell everyone not to go here.",0
Only issue I have is there is typically no place to park if you drive. Oh and the bums taking up all the seats outside. WTF??,0
Great place to salsa dance on a Saturday night!!  A brief lesson is given by some great professionals-check it out!!,0
2 people paid over $100 for horrible service and nasty food...now I feel even more sick to my stomach :(,0
This place is an old school steakhouse. Absolutely delicious!! Hidden gem. This type of place is a dying breed. If I lived here it would be a regular spot. Ask for Chip!,0
"Every time I come here they mess something up. Whether it be medium instead of large, everything instead of plain, regular fries when I ask for curlies, this place does it all. Do not come here if you can help it.",0
"It's like a blue Home Depot, just backwards.",0
"The food was great, but the service was absolutely terrible. I think it took nearly 90 minutes for dinner for 2 people. It's a great choice when Lotus of Siam has a long wait, but be prepared for spotty service.",0
"If you like dog food, then go to this lousy place for food.",0
"An excellent restaurant. Quality of food is high. Imaginative menu. We have eaten here before and will do so again. Well run and well managed, but hectic before AZ.",0
Another great trip to Lox Stock! The bagels and service are the best!,0
Nice local place! Great late night specials and the bbq ribs are fall off the bone great.  The bartenders are friendly and know how to make a great drink.,0
Denied service because our party of 7 is too big?! They can't sit parties larger than 4. Happy to take my service else where.,0
We have gone to Laredo's many times over the years. On our trip there last Wednesday night my son ordered the Rio Bravo. He was sick with food poisoning later that night and into the next day.,0
"The Nugget is probably my favorite place to stay, why? because it cost as much as the Concha Inn but has the style and class of any hotel on the strip. In terms of comfort and style, I consider the cost inexpensive.",0
"I've eaten here a couple times, once for breakfast and once for dinner.  The food is good but overpriced for the amount you get.  The employees were nice and the service was fast.",0
"Very, Very good (great) donuts!!!",0
"Some seriously tasty pizza.  Felt like I was back in Italy again.  Love that they have pizza marinara listed right on the menu, which is an excellent option for vegan folks!",0
Just above bar food but fine in a pinch.,0
This quaint little place is a gem in Old Town Scottsdale.  The oven brick pizzas are amazing and the wine selection is great.,0
"Bacon Night (with dollar beers) and Fish Bowls, nuff said. A must go to bar for downtown Madison on the weekends.",0
"Awesome pho, broth is very flavorful, lots of veggies, and good portion of quality beef. They also have great service and reasonable prices. Best I've found in Phoenix, looking forward to going back and trying some of their other things.",0
"These guys are great!  Honest, reliable, and reasonable.",0
"Too expensive for a regular burger. Even smash burger better than this place. I've tried cheese burger but it's taste like a regular burger, no tasty flavor or special sauce to attract you",0
Great place to get ur car washed. Great friendly people. Best of all a clean car!,0
The service was absolutely fantastic and each dish was very unique although we didn't enjoy our drinks very much.  Very intimate atmosphere.  Great place for a date.,0
"Great food.  Great service.  Great people.  Great Value.\nBest sausage, peppers and onions around!",0
Great food & service!!!  Love their cheese enchiladas!  The price was excellent also.,0
"It's an institution, and if you live in AZ you need to eat here.  The food is off the charts and you'll leave very full with lots of money left over.  It doesn't get better...",0
So glad we found this place! Everything is fresh and tastes just like we get when we are in Germany! Walked out with some fresh warm pretzels last week too!  This is our number one place for authentic German meat.,0
This place is horrible! They said if you want real eggs you have to ask them. Very confusing why the name is the good egg if they do not even serve real eggs.,0
"Very pleasant place with an amazing appeal. The service was fantastic, food was quality, and again the patio on a beautiful March day was perfect. Will have to come back for dinner sometime.",0
"There are 2 types of \""Good\"" restaurants in Pittsburgh. There is Yinzer good and Actually good. This food is Yinzer good. Way too much butter and sugar. Yuck.",0
Nicely remodeled local bar with great service. There is usually a large mix of patrons from the working class neighborhood. Strong drinks for a good price.,0
Im a fan.  Their sliders are really good and the atmosphere is cool also.  If you go there during the day you can see the Real Housewives of North Scottsdale.,0
"Ah, another high school pit stop. This place is great for random gifts, humorous books and furnishings. Keep an eye out for their clearance items, great discounts.",0
Always great service at the bar from Tanya and Nikki. Great food and wide selection of draft beers. One of my favorite spots.,0
Nice looking waitress. Great food. Great service.  You can't ask for much better than that.,0
"an efficient way to eat - meat, cheese, fries and slaw! all the food groups in one delicious huge bite.",0
Dinner for 4. Everyone was happy for the most part. My salmon was a little salty. Hubs steak was delish! Everything looked great and our waitress was nice.,0
Love the stores selection but HATE how the girls chase you around to tell you their sales. If I wanted to know I'd ask!!!,0
This is a great storage facility - Clean and well maintained with reasonable prices.  Working with Nadia in the office is a joy.  She goes out of her way to be helpful,0
"Great food at reasonable prices. Not the most comfortable seating and the tables are crammed together pretty tight, but again the food is worth the trip.",0
Very unhelpful. The staff did not even attempt to address my needs.,0
Not always the best customer service but they do help.,0
"Zero stars!\n\nGive Cyndi B her money back, you sold her counterfeit CHANEL for $1,100.00!!!!",0
"This is a lovely resort, but more of an effort should be made to rid the lobby bar of flies...The spa is AMAZING!",0
Found my new barber and they even do flat tops. Old school my friends.,0
"I have never eaten here, but I have been to many parties here. They have a large back room for entertaining underage college kids. It gets really hot in there and their drink prices are ridiculous. I would not recommend getting drunk there.",0
Usually i am here after ive been drinking... so i see drunk people and i eat... thats about all im good for there. lol,0
THis place has great wings and its a cool hole in the wall type feel.  You can tell this place has its regulars as the servers knew people by name.  I will definitely be back for more wings and cocktails!!,0
This place was nasty... I wouldn't eat here ever again... It cost 60$ for 2 people and the food isn't worth 5dollars... I would have rather ate at McDonald's...,0
"This pizza is mediocre at best. Not really a NY style pizza - the crust is soggy, they finely chop the toppings - definitley not worth getting excited over.",0
Amazing bagels but average service. They are under staffed and also the manager isn't the nicest. She has a bit of an attitude.,0
Luggage took FOREVER to get.  Must have been standing there for at least 30 minutes.  Doh!,0
"I've definitely had better. The overall quality of all the food....veggies and chicken, was definitely poor. I ate it but will definitely not go there again!",0
I like this place! I always get my nails done by Mr. Du himself. He is the best. Talkative and sweet and he does a really good job.,0
Nothing fancy about this place. Just good old-fashioned thin crust pizza. Take-out only. And you can buy a bag of fresh pizza dough for a dollar.,0
"Signed up on the internet yesterday. Today, eating a full free breakfast and its good. Smartphone coupons,google it.",0
I feef that the waitress was not trained correctly and she should never have been fired,0
i went there once a while back and it was dirty and never went back... but if Stevey is right about the drink specials i might have to re-visit,0
"My husband and I like to come here on Sunday mornings for bloody Mary's, its hard to find a cocktail on a Sunday morning so this is our to go place when we want to waste away a day",0
This place is really cool. So many birds. The shows were very interesting as well. The food court has some good pizza too.,0
Cheap lunch buffet. But I don't like India food. Everything seems disgusting. And smelly.,0
i have not been here in a while but when i did go the food was rather good not too expensive at all i would return to this location,0
"If you like ribs, these are to die for. They are cooked in a process that lasts 3 days. These ribs are so tender, they fall off the bone. Even good to have extras for the next day for leftovers.",0
I have been coming here and all of their locations for 15 years. It is always an excellent experience and the food is excellent and very consistent even at different locations around the country. Great food at a fair price. Good friendly staff.,0
"Hostess was awful, but the waitress was nice! It's dead here and the food was awful. Will not be back. Such a shame because the location is great!",0
The service was horrible and the slowest I've ever experienced. I won't be back.,0
Since the changed menu yuk! Will not return.,0
Had dinner here last night. It's was ok. Not what I expected. Semi cafeteria type service.,0
"Good price, good food, and great drinks! A really cool place to unwind.",0
Very good egg flower soup! And authentic dishes... Staff is awesome.,0
The Food at Mama Ricotta's is very good!  The Pasta Entrees  are fresh and they have a wide variety of Dishes!!!!!!,0
"Newest update The owner here is charging.60 for a stinking refill that costs him 2 to 3 cents. I don't know what this guy is thinking. Greed, Greed, Greed!!!!!",0
Fabulous pizza and only 6 bucks for a large cheese?!?!?! I love this place.,0
"Great pizza, reasonable prices, fast service - cant ask for much more!",0
"Amazing hotel. Excellent staff. Great restaurants, prices are not bad either.  Bonus: Starbucks coffee in the room.",0
Very intimate and relaxed setting for dinner for two. They have excellent selections of wine and the food was very delicious.,0
"Restaurant hasn't changed in more than thirty years and is very dated. The food is generally good, and service is average.",0
"The food was no bueno, and I'm a little terrified that the only two diners robbed the place after I left. Very nice staff...and the prepackaged fortune cookie was tasty!",0
"I have only eaten one thing at HQ. I love the Mexico City burger.  Green chili, bacon,  cheese   Worth the drive from Casa Grande",0
I fly out of here mostly on business but I've spent 20 mins in security and 2 hours so its always a crap shoot.  Pun intended.,0
Their lunch specials are always quick and delicious. Reasonable price for lunch and you can get your appetitie going with chips and salsa.,0
"Had the special breakfast burrito, sadly it was not that great. They are super crowded in the weekends I think I will try them again for a real breakfast but not breakfast burrito.",0
"Great little place, lot's of games to play, cheap drinks. Needs more pool tables, or patrons who are willing to let other people play, and not hog the table.",0
Nice little zoo.  The monkey house is pretty awesome!   The Haunted Zoo thing during Halloween is fun!,0
"I was contacted today by Tiffany at BJ's in regards to my review and was issued an apology for the bad experience and offered a gift certificate to make a return trip, hopefully with better results. Great customer service on BJ's corporate part.",0
"UNLV, what can I say?  Rebel through and through!  Rebels baby, all about Rebels.",0
Not a bad place.\n\nNot a great place.\n\nPleasant enough service.\n\nFair pricing.,0
"The serving is good, but the steak dinner is not that good, also the sauce for the fried squid is strange.......",0
"Love this place...cool vibe, fresh breads, and unique options. So good.",0
A fun place to go with very friendly staff. Definitely attracts an alternative crowd!,0
A must stop every time I am in Phoenix.,0
"I had the blackened salmon, collard greens and yams. The collard greens were cooked  perfectly and the yams were delicious. Blackened salmon was a little overlooked and under seasoned.",0
The star is not for the food is for the service is a shame good food but bad bad service,0
Love this place!! amazing food. always fast take put. the chicken pasta with lemon vinegarette is my favorite!!,0
"Party room beastly hot.  Food very mediocre.  Waitress spilled hot meat juices from numerous plates on floor, table, and customers.  New York strip steak tasted boiled.",0
Theaters are clean and we'll kept.  Staff are friendly.  Popcorn is marginal at best stale!,0
The only place I go to for sweet and sour chicken. Its the best!,0
"When we arrived there was a wait, but it was well worth it. The portions were huge and the flavors delicious. The waffles were my favorite part... I would definitely return next time I am in Phoenix!",0
Since my son loved it - then it deserves a good rating!  It is what it is - average food but plenty of entertainment for the little ones.,0
Nice and cozy. Conveniently located. Just park and fly. Looking forward to getting some good use out of this place.,0
Overpriced goods but the staff is nice. SRP pay center in this store is handy.,0
"Any place that plays Sunshine Day by the Brady Bunch is okay in my book. Oh, and being greeted by a big ol' cock as soon as ya walk in a place... even better!",0
haha when i was here tryin to fly back to LAX and also back to NJ another time my flight was delayed...it was pourin out...it sure does rain a lot in NC!,0
Worst customer experience from these obnoxious pricks!,0
I refuse to be treated like a criminal by default. I WILL NOT give up my personal property becaue they think I might steal something. \n\nMost of the stuff in this place is junk.,0
"It looks a little scary, but don't let the carpet on the floors scare you. The food was fantastic. I would eat here again.",0
"I am back! The foods still greats, the services awesome and now they have beer and wine..lol!",0
Food does not make up for slow and poor service. Chips/ salsa were average,0
Huge amount of space and clean facilities--great for big conventions. Parking is only $3 and pretty big parking lots on top of that! It's RIGHT off the highway which is so convenient!,0
Always an hour wait. My cats would get sick every time after coming home from here. They are strictly indoor cats. Also way over priced even on the half off days.,0
"Prices are okay. \nTheir bakery section is not good, so don't go there and expect to find a nice loaf of crusty bread. Plus the store feels dirty.",0
we call to check on buffet waiting line on valentine's evening and the hostess was very rude and nasty. if u are working and hate ur job get another one.,0
"Awesome!  We ate here several times and everything was very good.  Good service, clean place, and the noodles...",0
"We go there for most of our fresh foods, it doesn't have the feel of a neighborhood grocer but the quality and selection are terrific.",0
Room smelled like sweaty sneakers.....disgusting!!  Requested a room change and second room wasn't quite as smelly but still had an odor.  Will never stay here again!!,0
"I have been to this place once and it was really nice, but I've heard that it is really great, so now I'm going to have to go again and really get into the groove.",0
Great asparagus split pea Parmesan soup! Cesar salad had a bit too much dressing. But chicken on it was perfect!,0
Pizzookie. It's the mic drop.,0
"It's a mall what do you expect? LOL! \nBut, it's a nice mall for Phoenix (Try going to metrocenter and than tell me how horrible arrowhead is!)",0
The service is so slow it's ridiculous.  It can take 20-30 minutes for a cup.  It's an okay product but the service is unbearable.,0
Went here for the first time and had breakfast. The hashbrowns and pancakes were awesome. Can't wait to go back for lunch sometime.,0
"Besides the fact they take awhile to bring your food, I love this place. Me and friends come here all the time when we're craving Chinese food. Delicious!!",0
"Love this place.  Great food, great staff...  The chocolate peanut butter dessert put it over the top!",0
Both my wife and I got sick the next day after eating at Carrabba's.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive but the food was not prepared fresh or kept at safe temperatures. We will not be eating here again.,0
"okay so the veal was \""good\"", but to advertise as good for kids and not have booster or high chairs is a stretch to say the least.",0
I will never come back to this restaurant again. The worst service I've ever experienced.  Watch out for being overcharged on your bill.,0
"If you want good (even great) food and GOOD service, just walk down the street a block or so to Bandera",0
"Terrible. Do not honor their warranties in tim,ely fashion.",0
"We were not greeted during the 5 minutes that we browsed the store while the salesmen were on their cellphones behind the counter, so we walked out. Prices of safes 'on sale' were outrageous.",0
Food was good.. A little disappointed in my Berry Sangria.. Wish it looked and tasted as good as the picture. Nothing stood out to me tho. I might go back for their cheese sticks tho:),0
"The food is good, however the staff is very uninviting, and the store is also pretty dirty.",0
"The pool is simply amazing!! Perfect for families, young 20 year olds and all the other age groups. The buffet is A+ as well. One of the best hotels you will find downtown.",0
Pretty good bar food.  It's conveniently located and a fun atmosphere.,0
"It's not very large, but it's a lot of fun. The penguins are great, and we really enjoyed how close you could get to all the birds. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable.",0
Nice retaurant in AZ...Nice selection and very authentic. I definitely recomend this place if you are in Phoenix area.,0
"Place is horrible period.....,,went for all you can eat sushi quality is poor and on top of that a ton of rice!",0
Food phenomenal! Service can be hit or miss.,0
Buyer beware if your gambling at the bar and you're winning your drinks are not free. Plus I order dinner as well so what I'm saying is the server should warn you that the drinks are not free. I will never go back,0
We've been coming here for years.  The food is ALWAYS great and I agree that the service is great without hovering.  Their lunch menu is the best value as well as the best chinese food in town,0
Awesome! I did not expect to have such a pleasant experience at a tire place. They were helpful anf quick. Every one was smiling and said hello. Great service. And they match any price.,0
they just wanna get rid of you and charge you. worst great clips ever,0
Habenero burger has great beef. The heat could be cranked up another couple of notches.  The carne adovada is great,0
My SUV is 13 years old and has never had a wax job. The finish was dull and faded. Full Circle restored my vehicle's finish like new in about 3 hours.,0
"As a non-drinker, I love loitering at this bar.  Great for avoiding that awkward peer pressure moment.",0
This repair shop is NOT open 24/7 as it states on Yelp. I tried to bring my car here at 730am and they were closed.,0
"Substitute cheese for actual flavor, burnt & limp potatoes, portions huge, unable to split checks, locally run. I support cuz its not a chain.",0
"Great video store...huge selection of indy and foreign films, as well as mainstream.  Employees give ratings on some of the movies.  Only downside, some of the people behind the counter have huge attitudes.",0
"so so so so many issues from bad customer service, super expensive, and then surprise charges on your bill\n\nFILE A COMPLAINT AT THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU!!!",0
"We went back a second time because we thought the poor service and food was just a fluke. However, the waitress & hostess attitudes were still just as nasty as the food.",0
This place is adorable!  You can order coffees to go and take out orders or you can eat there.,0
Solid 3 1/2 stars.  Sashimi was super fresh.  All the cooked foods were not bad either.,0
"today I went there for dinner.\nboy, the quality drop significantly. the fish was bad. the rice was bad. after all this time, :(I guess its time to start looking for new sushi place.",0
"Huge, delicious, decently priced burger.",0
On our way out of Vegas stopped for the night at a nasty hotel(not here)...all was erased when we checked out the buffet as,0
Pretty darn good overall. The garlic bread was AMAZING. The pasta was better than average. The decor was nice and comfortable. Looking forward to coming back soon.,0
The service sucks. The food is ok. Don't let the good ambience of the place fool you. The only good thing is the chips and salsa.,0
We dined here as part of a large party and had buffet style price fixed option.  Food was terrible and not anything resembling Cajun.  I would not return if they were giviing it away for free.,0
Never get my online order in less than an hour. I'm done!,0
"It's a Red Lobster, well kept and usually a wait but not too long. If you're not familiar with Red Lobsters, it's a decent American style seafood chain and make sure you try the biscuits.",0
"When something goes wrong, they don't stand behind the food they sell.",0
"To my knowledge, this is one of the last Pizza huts with a lunch buffet. Friendly staff, had a great time.",0
"Cozy and dim lighting. Food is okay - large quantities for take-out, watch out!",0
Pharmacy: They only have 1 person staffing this location. Takes more than 30 minutes to fill a Rx.,0
Good food but the young staff can never get any to go order right. They are too busy talking about their social life,0
"I can see why people could get married here. Its nice, quick and efficient.",0
They were 25 minutes late. I called and was told they were only 5 minutes away.  Ten minutes late I called and told they would be there in 5 minutes.  Would not recommend.,0
The bottom line is Gold Bar is a local spot with a devoted clientele.  It is chill and comfortable.,0
I ordered an arrangement for a celebration of life and they never delivered and didn't call to warn me. Didn't receive a call until the next day. Unprofessional and unreliable!,0
"Great Service, Great Hair Cut, Great Prices!",0
"This place is awesome! Great ambience, friendly staff, and great food and beer. This was a phenomenal first experience, an I will be back.",0
I've eaten here a half dozen times. The Shrimp burrito is worth the trip. Service is so-so. Bean and cheese burrito is good to.,0
"Opted to try a noodle soup. Description did not include that shrimp was part of the soup. Sadly, not being able to eat shrimp, my entire to-go order was a waste. No happy belly on this trip.",0
"This place smells, is in a crappy location and was a total dive. Went to 20 pubs last trip to Vegas, this was the worst and the bartender Matt is a total douche.",0
This place is consistently wonderful. We had our rehearsal dinner here and it was incredibly well run.,0
got copies of keys made here and they keys did not even work properly in my door. felt like i was pick locking my own front door. shit like this is a no-no in my book. damn you Ace.,0
Horrible experience. Make sure and read everything because they will lie to you about what you are signing in order to make some extra money.,0
"Wow!...you would think they would want to serve you beer. 20 minutes here, it's dead and we had to fetch our beers.",0
"This was a good restaurant but the menu has been downgraded to Bar Food, too bad as this was our go-to place when out on the lake.",0
good pizza. even better drinks. better service. cool place to hang out on weekends with some buddies.,0
Went to a gala here. It was very disappointing. I wouldn't buy a plate with my own money.,0
"um, no. Group dinner here was terribly bland. Wine and food disappointed izquierda y deracha. This is the Olive Garden of Phoenix.",0
"Hey it's a Starbucks! Friendly staff, good drinks and a good location. Can never go wrong with your favorite drink here.",0
"Great restaurant, MUCH better than the Italian Grotto we just walked out of. Warning, the hamburger is HUGE and couldn't eat the whole thing.",0
"Extremely friendly staff, very comfortable decor, and delicious food!  I enjoyed a sampling of a few different mezes and a greek salad - just wonderful!",0
Terrible store lay out.  Clearly designed by a tired 3 year old with ADD,0
"I won't be back. The food was OK, but the temperature of the food coming off the buffet was not what I would consider safe. I won't press my luck by going back.",0
WOW!  It was awesome. Peppers suffer with dungeness crab.,0
A dealer ' s release of wrong information is labelled as a fraud to cheat the consumers!,0
Great Response and attention to Detail. I'm grateful for people that care and want to be here. Great Staff. Thank You.,0
"Wasn't terrible,\nBut certainly wasn't great.\nSave your hard-earned cash.",0
"Average. Nothing great, nothing terrible. Food was good enough and the people were a little rude, but all in all, you get what you pay for.",0
What a wonderful little greasy spoon diner. Breakfast special was AWESOME and totally worth the reasonable price. Nice little local place with good food and a basic atmosphere.,0
BEST PRIME RIB..  but the side dishes lack.  You wont leave hungry however.  The biscuits with honey are the bomb!!!    Other great items are the Ribeye steak and of course the chicken fried steak.......,0
Their food was super delish. Their portions were huge so next time I prob would have split the plate. Def would go again,0
Great food... Great service... There is a very comfortable cozy atmosphere. The prices are reasonable and you get a good amount of food. This was my first time and I highly recommend!,0
I once walked in to see a guy w a French fry salad. The guys at Coney Island will make my meal up just the way I like it. The burgers are fantastic! Customer service is excellent. BikeForce delivers too!,0
Yum yum yum. Hungry for Gyros? This is your place.,0
Very expensive and the doctor gave me the creeps.,0
Darrell and his staff helped me make the most beautiful custom necklace for my wife  commemorating the birth of our first son.,0
Very happy that I got to play with big boy toys.,0
gino's is awesome! friendly and helpful!,0
"If you like bland, salty, greasy Chinese food...this place is for you. I'll just head across the street to Chow's Kitchen.",0
Eat a hamburger...because that was all that was worth mentioning here.,0
Best place in town for wing's. Good family restaurant. They always have something new to offer. You will always get service with a smile :-) Babs,0
"The food was really good, the service was really bad.... Lindsey the FOH Manager took great care us and it wasen't neccessary. Thank You.....",0
Nice place to play and eat.  Never stayed here though I hear it's nice.  They have great midnight specials.  Old property with tons of gaming options.,0
"The carpets came out great and dried quicker than expected. I wanted to give them 5 stars, but Luis was clearly disappointed when I didn't go for the upsell.",0
"I must be a fan. This is the only place I go to get our water bottles filled. Real nice layout, plenty of facets for 5 gal bottles, friendly staff + ice cream. What isn't there to like.",0
Food is always great and the service is very attentive... We'll go back another day.,0
If you are ever in town the ying yong is awesome. This is a very unique and excellent restaurant. I would highly recommend.,0
I got tired of waiting in line with one register open and 10 people in front of me. Won't be back.,0
By far the best cigar/ pipe selection  with a lounge in the Pittsburgh area!  Great employees and very knowledgeable as well! A must to come by too!,0
"The just fine egg would probably be a better name. Good potatoes, bad hollandaise. Good coffee. OK service.",0
"Cash only. It's a bit pricey for crepes, but it's great to have the restaurant to fulfill crepe cravings :)",0
Good pho with fast service! The spring rolls are amazing! Place is really clean,0
I love this place! Sally is the best!,0
"Delicious. We had beef bun, spring rolls and beef ph\u00f4. Nice little place to stop for quick dinner before the movies - conveniently next door.",0
"We came here for my husband's birthday.  The service was attentive and very warm, the Steaks and lobster were perfectly cooked and moderately priced... How can you go wrong?",0
"Make sure you eat before you get there, not much there.",0
Blehh!\n\nIs that even meat in the.50 cent tacos?,0
Nice place. Food was pretty good. Great service. Very respectful. Be careful if you are not used to eat spicy food.,0
"The food and the service was horrible.  It was my first time, but was not impressed.  The service never came to ask how we were or to refill our drinks.",0
"A sagat award restaurant, and deserves it! Love this place, every time I am in town. I'll try and stop by, located in Sam's Town. It's worth it!!",0
ummmm...ummm...There is a Captain Morgan statue in the back. \n\nThat is about all I got! Drinks are overpriced and the door staff is a bit much.,0
"Great pizza, quick service - both eat-in, with the specials, and pick-up. Original build-your-own is a good value.",0
WIth an area that is lacking a nice place to go for lunch this place really hits the spot.  Service is great and food is excellent.,0
"Poor service and food is overpriced. The food should taste a lot better for what you pay. Also, it's really hard to get a table.",0
I was served dirty plates and the most awkward cup of green tea ever (a plastic cup full of large leaves with a bit of hot water)...when I complained..of course no one spoke english. This place sucks..,0
"Ugh the sushi is terrible here!! There is no flavor and its dry! I have had tons of experience with sushi...the good, the bad, the food poisoning!!",0
Service was slow people here seemed very confused on what was going on they have boxes laying around the store it's 3 stars at best,0
"Great food, huge portions, waiter knowledgeable about ingredients. We'll enjoy this just as much as the takeaway as we did in the restaurant!",0
"The chipotle chicken panini was delicious and large.  Very hot, flavorful, juicy, and reasonably priced (especially for an airport).  They even gave me a delicious chocolate chip cookie.  Definitely recommend.",0
I just don't get it.  The food is terrible and way overpriced.,0
"Terrible! Wings tasted like they were all made at the beginning of the day, then reheated when sold. Pizza was below average. \n\nWasted $22",0
Favorite part of the meal - hush puppies and sweet tea! I think i can just eat that for dinner.,0
"The fish and chips were fine. The fish was hot, the fries were decent steak fries, and the service was prompt and knowledgeable. I would return.",0
My sandwich was tasty. It was ready soon after I ordered it. Pretty good. I'd go again.,0
Expect the slowest service you have ever seen.  3 hours for a meal on a Sunday night.,0
I ordered the spinach rice and beans which was excellent. Service was slow to start I waited 10 minutes for a cup of tea. Lunch is a very busy time but it'd still return because the food is very good,0
"Absolutely love the food here, but unfortunately they don't take to go orders. I called this morning and the lady refused to let me place an order. It's the 21st century get with the program.",0
The credit card system is down  and they don't tell you until you get up to order. So than you are stuck in line to pull through.,0
"Pretty Ok food. I ordered Kung Pao chicken, it really didnt have that much chicken but it had a great flavor. Also order Egg fried rice and that was good too.",0
so good to return and find it still here after all these years. wonderful food and service! great little market to get some grocery shopping done too! thank you. see you again soon!,0
"Ottos is awesome, it is such an underrated pizza place. I highly recommend grabbing a slice if you're nearby! Great staff too!",0
Smells like a public restroom in the diner. Avoid at all costs!!!,0
Best general tsos chicken ive ever had. Service was good. My drink was refilled when i needed it to be. Couldnt ask for much more. Definitely visit this place if you want great chinese food,0
"I love this park, and my dogs do too!\n\nIt's beautiful and well maintained. \n\nEven on a busy day there's still plenty of room to walk around, exercise, or have a picnic!",0
"Tasty...reasonable price, ample portions.  The chicken shwarma is delicious.",0
Meh. What's all the hype about? It's hard to believe it's run by the same people as Monty's diner because the service and food quality are so much lower. Not worth the wait.,0
"Pro's:\nFriendly staff, well maintained beds and great location!\n\nCon's:\nEvery single door in the salon seems to be broken along with the door lock.",0
Really needs a renovation. Stayed in 2007 and came back in 2011. Nothing has changed and I doubt it ever will.,0
"Best Vet ever!  No nonsense! No trumped up charges. Tells ya like it is. Awesome disposition. Genuine, sincere, considerate, caring personable demeanor.",0
Watery bloody and slow service. Terrible management.,0
Food not genuine but is reasonably good. White rice was old hard and crusty. \nI will have to find better Chinese and I will.,0
Always raising prices on us as well as the worst customer service over the phone... fighting with us about how they have the best everything and really they don't we are no longer customers with them!,0
Had to share an actual picture of the deliciousness this time. Mussamen chicken curry with egg. Love this menu item!,0
"Fresh, unique fish and great service.  Highly recommended for anyone who wants something different. Don't forget to check in.",0
If I could give them a ZERO I would.  Forget customer service.  If you have a technical problem....hire someone.  They NEVER answer the phone!!!!!  I wish they didn't have monopoly.,0
Great pizza the white  pizza is the bomb!! Their wings are delicious as well! The guys are always super friendly!!,0
"OK airport. Layout is fine - food choices vary across terminals; in mine, not great choices. Clean & bright. Conveniently located to suburbs around Phoenix. It works -",0

"Love this place.  Went here with a friend who lost a bet and had to buy me lunch and have been back several times since.  The people are friendly, and the sandwiches are amazing.  I reccomend the KGB.",0
Good place to watch a game but the food is terrible.  Went there about four times and had to send the food back every time because it was cold!,0
"Pretty expensive, but the flavor can be improved much. The salmon smells weird.",0
Great european style boutique hotel.  You can not beat this hotel for the money!,0
"I'm not usually a sushi fan, but I loved it here!  Service was ok... but the food was great!!",0
I was a little disappointed with Eldorado Grill but definitely plan on going back to give it another chance because it had potential.,0
"Hard to find unless you know where it is (mysterious sounding, I know).  Staff is friendly.  Large selection of alcoholic beverages.  Good food.  Good prices.  Stop by if you get the chance.",0
I'm a New Yorker and it's been hard finding a pizza place that is like home. While it isn't completely NY style pizza it's pretty close.,0
"Very nice facility, very nice staff and great coffee!! I can not complain.",0
Absolutely love this place! Jill and Eric are amazing! Service can't be beat!! The Little cheesy omelet is perfect size.,0
Just a pawn shop with expensive stuff. too much pawn stars tee shirts and junk.,0
"food was expensive, service was a-ok. mediocore",0
Had noodle soup in the restaurant section.  The soup was OK but it was hard getting past the stagnant aquarium smell wafting in from the grocery area.  Interesting place but I probably won't be going back to eat here.,0
Excellent food! Excellent service! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a great meal with great service.,0
What a wonderful place! The workers are so helpful! They were able to resize my wedding ring (bc after I gained all my baby weight it didn't really fit anymore) Thanks guys! Keep it up!,0
"Potatos are amazing, a very solid breakfast choice. Bluberry infused french toast is ridiculously filling",0
The service is extremely slow and the cashier is in no hurry to help customers. The staff would rather talk about there lifes to each other than service the person that pays there pay check.,0
Long wait ok service good thing they have the ultimate feast otherwise I would never come:,0
"it was ok, no music or anything fun going on. He re polished my toes which lasted a long time. :-). Manicured my nails ok",0
BBQ shrimp...\nFried oysters...\nRBR...\n\nAll brilliant.,0
Great for kids haircuts. Terrible for adults. Never going again,0
This place seem a lot dirtier then I remember food wasnt as good I wont be back,0
Great place but I'm only giving 4 stars because the chicken sandwich I ate tasted weird. I'm not picky but it tasted like a bad piece of chicken.,0
Used to be a great dive to shoot pool/darts. Now over priced and boring. Might as well be a Starbucks,0
This is a cute bar. Pretty small. Wish it attracted a younger crowd..felt really out of place.,0
"I just want to get inside. Ive been there 3 times and been turned away by security for \""Clothes\"", which were very similar to what others were getting admitted with. Forget it. I ain't going back.",0
Fun local neighborhood place to go. Old school Italian! Friendly staff with character!! Great pasta and fish special!  Italian wedding soup super per my 11 yr old. BYOB great too!,0
My mom just called me and said this store is getting closed in Mid-June.,0
I called to ask if they buy swords.. And the guy hung up on me. How rude.,0
Good fish...try the Rainbow roll it is all good...my only problem with this fine establishment is that the.place has a strong fishy smell...that is why I don't come so often...keep up the good work guys...,0
"Drove past for years, ate there first time last week. Delicious. High quality. I'll definitely be back!",0
"Cool staff, nice selection. They had lots of pre used and old systems. If you haven't been to a game stop you need to go. Rewards  program is legit.",0
This is certainly my favorite place in the valley to get good Thai food!  The flavors are fantastic!  I never leave still hungry!,0
"The surgeon was good, but the Anesthesiologist was a joke.  Full of himself.  Thought he was a top notch surgeon.  not impressed.",0
"The owner seems like a nice guy, but the other person who works there is bad enough I won't come back.",0
"My favorite Chinese spot in town!!! Legit and very tasty Asian Cuisine is surved here every night. When I want real Chinese, not Panda, this is where I end up. I highly recommend it!",0
"Maybe because I have lived in New York, but I was really not impressed with the pizza. The crust was gluey and not crispy enough. The place itself was fine but I would not come here for the pizza again.",0
"It's a nice hotel for what it is. Cheap!\n\nRoom was decent, had a clean shower and refrigerator. \n\nBed was soft. What else could you ask for?!",0
Food was amazing!!! Just wish it were open on Sunday :),0
"This store has such bad service. The service staff are rude rude rude.  Save your money, shop elsewhere.",0
"Love the view and good food.  Had the lobster carbonara as my meal with the king pao green beans.  They are both listed as sides, but make a surprisingly great pairing.  Enjoy!",0
No doubt food was very awesome and service also very nice.,0
Very poor service. Unremarkable at best.,0
Good place to grab breakfast that doesn't cost a fortune.,0
Great place for happy hour with fantastic prices and the food was really good!  Very nice service as well.,0
I bought a train set here for my son for Christmas.  He passed away due to cancer unable to use the train.  Roy's Train World would not take back the unopened train set.  Heartless.,0
"I used to love Paradise Bakery. They had such good salads. But the last few times I've eaten there I noticed their food has gone way downhill. It's so bad, I won't be eating there again. Too bad :(",0

All they did was try to up sell me.,0
Visiting Tempe and was just walking off dinner and decided to stop in for a beer.  Wound up smoking a good cigar and having a few pints.  Very friendly staff,0
The service was great but the food was horrible. I had a chicken sandwich with a side salad. The salad looked like it was swimming in a pool of Ranch dressing and the salad itself looked old. The chicken sandwich was plain.,0
They charged up twice for the same order and then yelled at me on the phone saying that because I didn't have my recite on me it wasn't there problem and hung up on me,0
"Overpriced, mediocre food, uninformed and disinterested service. Will not return.",0
"Great food, but you'll pay for it!  Not cheap...  Plus some of the servers aren't Japanese, geez.",0
"Tempura, service, and beer special good... quality of product BAD!!! Not worth the value.",0
"Nice place for happy hour...\n\nGood drinks, good food, always busy too.\n\nThe location is excellent, the crowd is beautiful, and the sushi is perfect.",0
I use to go here. But I really think they water down their drinks.,0
"The pollo mole is well worth the trip out here.  Service friendly and quick, lots of my favorite dishes on the menu.",0
"Really nicely maintained location - doesn't smell like a \""pet store\"" like so many others and their outreach/adoption programs are great.",0
"What's there to say. It's Denny's. The foods not awful, but not great either. It works in a pinch after a night of bar hopping.",0
Horrible greasy food.\nGm didn't care at all when we complained.\nManagement reflects overall very poor experience. My tummy still hurts!,0
Amazing 7 course tasting meal but pretty expensive.  $125 fixed price so with 5 was quite pricey.  However food was amazing and staff were top notch!  Will go back!!,0
"Without a doubt, the most friendly employees I have come in contact with in quite some time.... and this was 20 minutes before they closed the dining room.  Everything was fresh tasting and hot.  We were very pleasantly surprised.",0
Nice looking place... food wasn't bad... just something I didn't like... not sure what... sorry for the horrible review.,0
"Western omelet was good,  service was nice...",0
"Being originally from the Bronx, I am usually skeptical about pizza outside of NYC. But the pizza here is great! Thin crust, just the right amount of sauce, and awesome, salty cheese. I am so glad to have found this place!",0
"Food is ok, kind of bland. Chicken was chewy and cold. Nothing special about service either.",0
It's what health-intelligent people are looking for. You are now home.,0
"Very bland food, no flavor.  Unimpressed. Quiet atmosphere. Will not be return.",0
Food was good. Also try some shrimp with your meal. They have pretty good customer service. I would come back again,0
"Unfortunately, this administrative fee will prevent me from ever going back.  It's sad b/c I feel the care was really great.",0
golden medium wings!!!!!!!! Also really good beer specials and they have some really good looking waitresses,0
Sonic food at it's finest.   We had dinner at midnight and everything was made fresh.  I couldn't ask for anything more.  The chili cheese coneys were delicious.,0
"To many rules. No split checks, no credit cards, no substitutions or additions, no breakfast after 11. Staff is nice, food is average.",0
"I live down the street, and would love to be supportive, but the last time I was there, it was average food at above average prices.",0
Went one time.. They messed up the order.. Forgot my mash potatoes and the chicken wasn't good at all.. The worse popeyes I've been to and I've been to alot,0
"Absolutely great. Not a traditional setting, but the food is fantastic. Good for lunch or dinner. Skewers of meat, veggies, Turkish coffee, yogurt soda...",0
"If you are trying to decide what charity is most worthy of your contributions, donate to Gracie's Cottage.  Come see for yourself how this thrift store does everything from supporting the local community to supporting missionaries around the world.",0
I will no longer buy bagels here anymore. No matter which kind you buy they all taste like an onion/garlic bagel...even the cinnamon sugar!,0
Had the BBQ sandwich on Focaccia. Really good!,0
Still my fav! Drive 15 miles when I go just for a slice!,0
The front desk is rude. My appointment time was not honored and they expected me to wait over an hour. I can't say enough bad things about this doctors office. And it looks like you'll catch something in the waiting room.,0
The worst most over breaded oysters ever...It's a dive to boot.,0
Went for lunch  closed   All signs are off the building no notice. What happened?   Pfft gone!,0
Paul came over to inspect for termites. He was on time and friendly. After 10 minutes he said there were no termites and he did not charge me!!! I will be calling him in the future!!!,0
Love the red chili beef burros. Hearty basket of chips and salsa served upon being seated. Friendly staff.,0
Terrible day. 6+ hour round.  No one took responsibility. Terrible breakfast sandwich. Filthy bathrooms. Course was burning out in May. Bought a Corona but they could not afford the lime. Someone needs to manage this course,0
"love this place they do an amazing job! I like how the nail shop is right by my house and very convenient for me. They also do an amazing job with eyebrows thats the only place i go to, to get my eyebrows done.",0
Horrible it's smell horrible it was super dirty worse food experience ever,0
"One of the better Chinese food restaurants in Pittsburgh. The food is pretty authentic, and while they have your standard American Chinese food, they have some genuine-tasting Cantonese dishes too.",0
"Service was terrible, completely oblivious attitude.  food quality not great, cheap ingredients and you can taste the difference plus they play annoying teenybopper music with douchey clientele",0
"This place is great. Refreshingly different, good atmosphere, well made drinks and reasonable prices.\n\nCouldn't give the full 5 because of the location - it isn't close to anything.",0
"Excellent food and large family style portions, my favorite is the veal parmesan. Been here numerous times and they get really busy, not always the best service and is pretty pricey.",0
"Eh, I was hungry, nothing else was open at 3am.",0
Yummmyyyyyyyyy truffles!,0
Useless.  If they don't get you on a big sell...they great you like crap.  My mother was taken advantage of.  Sad.,0
Food so good you just want to fuck it rather than actually eat it!,0
"Super friendly staff, good prices, and I've heard rave reviews of the live entertainment they get.  Wish they had a menu, but it's just a little place.",0
I have eaten here multiple times and my meal has always been fresh and good tasting. The mountain high mud pie is always great if you have the room for it after dinner!,0
"Great place great service Michelle is an amazing Waitress,  you will given great service for sure if you are fortunate enough to have her as your waitress!",0
"Staff is friendly, selection is so-so, which is about what can be expected for a shop of this size. Middle of the road for used bookstores in Vegas.",0
I don't understand the hype for this place. Service was ok and my filet mignon was SO overcooked and lacked flavor. The only decent part about my meal was the molten chocolate cake. Will not come back.,0
"Soda is ALWAYS flat here, if I'm going to pay for soda i'd like it to be decent... Table was dirty as well",0
"Really crappy service, they could not have cared less about me or my injury, I would avoid these people.",0
Its what you would expect. Old world charm with new cuisine. Always elegant and great service a new york classic! I usually frequent more trendy dining establishment but visit the historic sites are just as good.,0
"I would rather be punched in the face, than eat anything from this Cook on Wok location.",0
"Wonderful mall! A nice blend of high end stores and regular priced stores. Parking can be annoying on the weekends so I'd recommend getting there close to opening or more towards closing if you need to go on a Saturday or Sunday,",0
"Horrible restaurant. They don't seem to care about customer service, and very often make errors on my order. I usually have to repeat my order at least twice. I know its fast food - but this place is bad.",0
Just got rolled by this cab company! Cab lady took us from the Stratosphere all the way South of town to the Airport. It cost $46.00 and took about 25 minutes!!! DO NOT DRIVE WITH THESE PEOPLE!!!!!,0
"Not exactly an upscale mall by a long shot.  Service is horrendous and it is crowded and messy, with a poor selection of low grade stores.",0
So those pictures on yelp of the view from grandview? I snapped those exact same ones using my own camera. For a grand total of $9 + 2.75 atm fee. Bring exact change.,0
Nice campus to visit. It's pretty big and I found it a little easy to get lost (it's very spread out) but not bad.,0
"Very friendly, quick service, and great food.  Hands down one of my favorite places to go eat!",0
Great service and okay food. I ordered 5-Spicy level (where 4 is Thai hot) and the food came out tasting sweet. I love La's Thai on McDowell and Hayden much better,0
General to chicken not real spicy without asking works for us but the broccoli garnish was frozen...Curry is fine for casual dining....\nWould repeat for the lunch special probably...,0
Ordered but then she kept telling me all their different specials. Finally said ok to 3 roast beefs. Just got home. Order totally wrong. Not going back.,0
"Awful everything. From the bad service, to the diluted soup, to the lame-no chicken on the chicken salad, to the PRE-fabricated pizza. AVOID THIS PLACE!",0
"Love the small town and family owned feel of this place! The staff was sweet, attentive and prompt...even on Mother' day!",0
$90 service charge to start for Hot Tub Repair.  That's just the service call. Well see how they do:),0
SUCH Terrible food NEVER AGAIN sooo disappointing,0
"This place is terrible, they opened a crappy cafe, everything tastes of cardboard.  The bathrooms are completely disgusting. The employees are lazy and rude, especially curly haired older guy.  Avoid this place like the plague",0
I might not have liked the wood fried Pizza. Loved the starters though but not all. Three cheese was good (liked only two of them) and the bread sticks. In general pizza was ok.,0
cashiers dont know how to count.  if you like loosing money come here,0
Pizza is good. But its over priced. We go here when our regular pizza place is closed.,0
"Area kinda shady...but best fried chicken in the city by far. Great prices also, I always recommend it to anyone who ask about chicken or soul food.",0
"If you are hard on your vehicles, buy the lifetime tire  balance and rotation for $ 50.00.",0
"If you cannot find something to read here....well you must have read every book on the planet!\n\nThe staff is great.  The inventory is mind-blowing, and it is locally-owned!",0
"The food was good, but I've had better and the prices were higher than the better that I've had.  This was table wine in a champagne flute.  I won't be back.",0
"Very rude girls working here! Then We got served dry chicken and greasy biscuits  food was really gross, will never ever return to this or any other churches!!!",0
"This location is fairly small. However, it still has a pretty decent variety of beers.",0
Excellent late night dining menu. Can't wait to go back during their regular hours. Service was great. Steven was our server and did a great job. Great margaritas!! :),0
"Was just on dirty dining! So nasty! Las Vegas, NV (KTNV) -- One of the most famous Chinese restaurants in town was shut down after a strongly-worded health inspection.",0
"I didn't find the food all that flavorable, the service isn't great, and it's definitely not worth the price.",0
"Great cocktails!  Brandy old fashioned was a work if art.  Salad was great, but steak was completely forgettable.  The bar is highly recommended",0
"Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere!  3 hours for a \""partial highlight\"" I went running out of the salon with wet hair! Worst experience in a salon ever...",0
Eggplant garlic sauce is awesome but it would be nice to have less oil in it :),0
Had huge problems with my insurance.\nKenny in the pharmacy made a ton of phone calls and went above and beyond.\nI have severe back problems and without his help I would have been back to the hospital.,0
"Pretty good food and usually a good time. Staff always seems nice and knows what they are doing, always seems busy also...they have cheap drinks and usually specials. I recommend the wings or the provolone(fried).!",0
"Delightful, we were there for Sunday brunch. Great food, pleasant conversation and very reasonable.  Making a point to return for dinner.",0
Director is rude. Setup is weird. Teachers don't care.,0
Best friggin wings ever. Ask for them GRILLED after frying!,0
I've probably eaten here 20 times.  10 times w/ my wife too.  Always good food and eaten a bunch of different things.  Good deal and good service too.  Food will surprise you,0
"Best place in bell road. Everything I ordered tasted too good and fresh. They have unique cuisine with different recipes, I have ordered several dishes and everything tasted excellent.",0
The service fees are ridiculous. I split paying their bill into two months because it was so high and they kept calling me. I don't know if their insolvent but their customer service is atrocious,0
"Without a doubt the coolest bar in vegas, the most awesome bartenders, the best machines ive played in vegas, and you can get the best pizza, wings, and sandwiches in vegas all in the same place. LOVE them",0
"Looking for a new nail place, this was convenient. Very average job though. Got a pedicure. People not that friendly. Place looked average clean. I decided not to get nails done there and probably will not go back.",0
"Good bean dip, OK chips. OK green chile, although they need a medium green option.  I don't understand why when going from CO closer to Mexico I can't find anywhere with mole sauce?",0
"Everything's fine here... they do seem to run out of chicken at times so like dark meat they were out of on a few occasions. otherwise I go back often, drive-through is fast and accurate.",0
"Not bad. A little pricey, but the food's good.",0
I'm never going to eat at this place again.  We usually come here every vegas trip but this last trip we found a cockroach in our calamari.  Totally disgusting.  \n\n****BEWARE****,0
Maintaince and maid service should be better.,0
So much for my previous review....expounding on the virtues of flame-broiled meat and that glorious smell it produces.\nThe place burned down last night.,0
This is no longer here. Boo.\nReally needed to go and it's as though it never existed!,0
"Food was very good.  BBQ pork yummy, good local beers and very good service.  Would come back again.",0
"Great personality, great skill as a Barber! Definitely my 1st pick if I'm ever in Mesa AZ. Great to meet you Mickey!",0
"Hummus was just great. I've trident their \""special\"" Greek wine and honestly didn't like it. Briefly - he'll of food worth the money.",0
"They misdiagnosed our cat as having diabetes. After the cat went into insulin shock they said 'well, sometimes it just goes away.' Seems like they to want to kill animals as expensively as possible.",0
we ate lunch here yesterday and everyone left happy and full!!!! it was good!!1,0
OVERHYPED.  I've had better burgers almost everywhere.,0
A lot of dishes are almost flavorless. Like others have mentioned their curries are almost embarrassing.   Large menu so I'd imagine there are some decent dishes but overall pretty blah.  One standout is their soups.,0
I love this store because it promotes healthy sex and relationships as well. It's a very body/sex positive and pro-woman business (not what I would normally expect from an adult shop).,0
"I'll eat here in a pinch. Noting great, nothing too horrible.",0
"I ate and drank at the lounge here during a recent summer stay at the Buttes.   I My favorite is the chips - the ones with bacon, blue cheese, and chipotle sauce...YUMM!",0
What a cruddy airport. It's ugly and uncomfortable.  The food choices in the southwest terminal are awful.  At least it has free Internet.,0
"Four stars for clean, three stars for the wall relief or sculpture or whatever, two stars for the food.  And food is what I went there for.\n\nScratch this one off my list.",0
"Okay so as I was eating it I was loving it. So tasty...but then about an hour later I was sick. I won't give you the gory details, but I definitely won't be going there again.",0
"The ribeye I ordered was tender, juicy, and tasty. I prefer it cooked at medium. But the one I got was a little bit over cooked. The restaurant ambiance was cozy. Our server was attentive and accessible.",0
We've had some pretty terrible experiences ordering L&C's from work.\n\nPizza's decent but the employee's and their attitudes need some adjusting.,0
Fun place to grab a beer and some food with friends. Old school atmosphere but if you want a local joint type place this is definitely the place.,0
This place has went down the drain. From one of our favorite weekly visits to probably some of the worst customer service. Very disappointed to what this place has become,0
Three words--chilli cheese fries.  YUM!,0
I love the food here. Love the vibe.,0
I had there apple pancake all I tasted was eggs it was disgusting. I will never come back here,0
Chicken black bean burrito was surprisingly good. Their food has gotten better than it was in the past.,0
Very popular and I have no idea why. Strictly there\ndue to being other people's choice. Many years and locations. Boring,0
"Professional, friendly staff for sure. Took in my Trek with a chain adjustment. Quick repair, great experience.",0
The best meat market in Madison. It has great gresh chicken brests. Get the burgundy marinaded steak. Check it out.,0
Super genuinely friendly staff. Plenty of flat screens to catch multiple games at once. Cold Stella on tap. Average pub grub.,0
"Meh. The bread was cold, the bean dip it's served with was cold, the mushroom dish that was described as served over risotto was served over cold orzo. Didn't knock my socks off.",0
"If by dive bar you mean \""shit hole\"" then yes this is a shi...I mean \""dive bar\"". Rude and inattentive bartenders. The crowd is lame, bunch of introverts.",0
Are you kidding me?? frozen bagels. I  rather go to the grocery store and pay way less for a frozen bagel. I am a fool thinking this place serves frozen food,0
"There is nothing terrible about this restaurant but there is nothing that good either - average food.   Given the price, it is definitely not worth it unless location is your primary concern.",0
"Its clean, open 24/7 with hot shoe string fries and creative milkshakes. What else do you want in life??",0
Brought several sweaters and a jacket to them to get dry cleaned and I was very disappointed in the job.  I was actually unsure whether they had actually dry cleaned anything and had to take all the clothes to another place.,0
"You can order your photo prints online and pick it up at the store. It is very fast, and thus the A-OK.",0
"try the wings, ask for honey bbq! they are the best",0
"The food is amazing, but you might want to consider carrying a weapon when you come. You might end up getting shanked.",0
"Same food and drinks, but older population compared to the tempe location. The atmosphere is more of a sports bar than a brewery.",0
"Always a fun place to find interesting toys. They have the usual (Legos, Playmobile, etc) but many of the unusual. A real treat.",0
Great food but it's way too expensive - 2 double burger meals with shakes shouldn't be almost $30.,0
This place doesn't have much to choose from. Waitresses take too long to clean up dirty tables. Beverage area was always dirty.,0
"Do not eat here.  It is awful!  The food tastes old, re-heated.  Really bad.  You couldn't pay me to eat here again.",0
"Service was great, and always an interesting time on a late Saturday night.",0
Best. Sushi. Rolls. Ever.  It's hard to eat at other sushi restaraunt's now.  The sauces on the rolls are amazing.,0
"Meh, indeed.  Decent beer and excellent service. But it's chain food and it didn't do much for me.",0
"Decent food.  Came more for the atmosphere and to yell \""big unit\"" every time someones orders one of their giant hotdogs.",0
Food was ok. Ordered to go. When I got home I saw that the order was wrong and food was missing. I guess you get what you pay for.,0
"Just moved to the neighborhood and decided to stop by for lunch on Saturday around 12:30pm. The door was locked, lights were off and chairs were still on the tables... not sure why they were not open during their regular business hours!",0
"Good waffles, I guess they should have since that's what their name is....lol\nAsked for crispy bacon but not as the way I like it.",0
Nothing too special.  Decent prices. PLace is also a hibachi place.,0
Not a large selction of any thingand over priced,0
"If your like frozen drinks, this is your place.  Had a hoping Mardi Gras party.  But I want more than just frozen cocktails at a bar.",0
aw more memories!  many a very early morning / late night meal at ritters... \n\nfood was always yummy...,0
"Excellent beer selection, delicious deli, enjoyable people watching- what more can someone want?",0
"Favorite dive bar. Get the dise burger - awesome! Cheap beer and drinks, very divy, so not for the faint of heart.",0
"Cheap Drinks, Cool Staff, Friday Night Karaoke, More then interesting people",0
It's nice if you can make it for happy hour before 7. Otherwise it's just average. Bartenders are really nice and personable though which is a plus.,0
Had lunch there on a rainy day. The light was dark so I did not enjoy eating there. The food was just so-so. No much choice on the menu. Don't know if they had another menu for dinner.,0
I would not come here again for anything. Everything is over priced... Really this is Just a Showroom for Amazon.,0
Everything about this place is DISGUSTING!!,0
Its where all the action is!!! The best!!!,0
This place would be awesome possum to go to when ur in town. I love how its nice and colorful inside. The workers there are nice and friendly with good service. The price are well priced. I would totally come here again.,0
"pee.  this place smells like it.  the 2nd star is for Gina, because she's good.",0
I used to go there was good food and the price was reasonable but now the food is sort of fairy and the price is skyrocket. Not worth going there.,0
So... the building shakes consistently. This is disconcerting on a number of levels and also probably provides any number of unpleasant metaphors.,0
"The waitress couldn't tell me which Shock Top they had on tap, and didn't know that a mudslide isn't always a frozen drink.\n\nAnd thanks place only takes cash.\n\nFuck this place.",0
"I don't come here to eat much, I usually come for the beer cave. Best build-your-own six pack joint in the city!",0
"If I can avoid flying into McCarran I will, and Henderson Executive is the place to go. Friendly staff and great location make this a great spot for ingress and egress from Sin City.",0
Indie pizza places always warm my heart\nTables outside on an alley remind me of Paris\nBut I know I'm in America because the soda has free refills,0
Rookie fliers..you can fight for the front seats in the airplane while I go to the back Burbank unboards com both front and back\n\nI need a drink,0
"First time here in a very long time, service was good, food was just OK. Probably won't be back, too many other eateries in Mesa to try.",0
"The Great Escape is Closed.  Now, unfortunately, it's the Little Woody.  Another pretentious take over.",0
Put it simple....Big warehouse for pets. Awsome deals. Huge selection. YOU HAVE GOT TO CHECK THIS PLACE OUT.,0
I'd rather drive to c3 or castle Shannon to hit the drive threw. Fast food isn't fast when u have to walk in. Desperately needs a remodel.,0
"Great little space. Go see the Christopher Jagmin show right now!!! His colorful, slightly loopy encaustic paintings are a great reminder that life is fun, dammit, and art can be too!",0
"The buses are filthy, but it's cheap. That's the only reason why I'm giving it a high rating. It's great from coming down from NAU.",0
They made me pay before the food came it and added tip they did not earn forgot to out my order in I would NEVER come back. This is Vegas you give great service and earn your tip and don't mess up without fixing it.,0
I have a bad experience when come here before and I never come back again. The food is not good as I expected. Maybe I come back some days and retry.,0
Great sushi bar. The staff and owner are extremely attentive. Great presentation. Decent price too. And I got to sit next to Mario Lemeuix at lunch a couple weeks ago!,0
"The food here is decent. I think it was one of the first places I ate at when I moved to Madison. If I ever stumble through Wisconsin again, I'll have to give it a try.",0
"I would never stay here again, i would rather not go to vegas if this was my only choice. Everything is old, rooms, AC, elevators, wings.",0
"Nothing special and the drinks aren't cheap. If you're going to be a sucky bar, at least give me cheap drinks.",0
Filthy place.  Bad tasteless food.  Rude waitress.  Yuck!!!!,0
"IHOP used to be good, but in recent years has become overpriced and very mediocre. You have to practically beg for warm syrup at this place. Seriously?",0
The meat and bread is so fresh that it makes Mr. Goodcents my number one sub place to hit up when in the mood for a sub,0
Three of the cities hottest and sweetest bartenders. Anything on the food menu is top of the line. Pizzas are off the hook. Sandwiches are sick,0
"All station casinos are great in general but I like the Boulder because it's never super congested, the cafe has some of the best pastries, they have all kinds of bonuses and perks for gamblers and the staff are so friendly.",0
"Their pad prik king is tasty, and their prices are very reasonable.",0
Get a Southside Shake with hot fudge shake and peanut butter sundae on top - absolutely amazing!,0
The standard breakfast is fine.  The unusual items are just unusual.,0
I had the Rigatoni Alla Bolognese and would definitely order it again.  I'm not sure about the value because the company picked up the tab,0
"Very average. Good service, friendly staff. Remind me of Mexican places from the 80s that didn't have particularly good flavor, so they just overwhelm you with stuff (guac, sour cream, pico, etc.)",0
So much better than Pei Wei right next door. I am a big fan of this place for lunch.,0
Wow how Applebee's has went down hill. Only good part of my meal was the celery sticks,0
"I don't know, an airport is an airport... All I have to say is, the taxi line is RIDICULOUSNESS right before party time!",0
"OMG this was good, crab tostada were to die for. I would have never discovered this place it it weren't for yelp. Next time we are in the area we will be back!",0
I've been here twice and really enjoy it.  Very beautiful plants and a real nice walk.  Both of my kids also enjoy it.,0
"My wife loves the gnocci.  It's a bit cramped so make sure you have reservations.  The menu is small but I've always found at least on dish to my liking, just never been blown away by anything yet.",0
"I don't know how they have a lot of good reviews. The service is blah. The food comes out quick, taste bland. Bad location. The place looks filthy.",0
It is better than 3 stars but not quite 4.  They have some pretty good dishes.  The vegi burger was amazing!,0
mini chicken pesto pizza for lunch is to die for! may look small but will be enough for two people! the cookie is amazing to!,0
"This is one of my favorite places to get Pho. It's made well here. Good flavor, not too oily. The egg rolls are delicious.",0
Slow service at Lons tonight. Great atmosphere.,0
"The location is quick and friendly but let's face it, it's taco bell.",0
"Surprisingly bland and tasteless, but must be popular, as it was very crowded on a Saturday lunch.  Beans are delish, tho.",0
"I love this place.  This is my favorite restaurant in all of Charlotte.  The food is great, the service is exceptional and friendly, and the atmosphere is unpretentious.  I highly recommend Mert's.",0
I'm really surprised when I read the reviews of the haters here. We live nearby and have been getting pizzas for years and have loved every one. Just had my favorite - the Classic Combo. Are the haters other pizza joints?,0
"Went for lunch. Food tasted fine. Portions were small and WAY overpriced. Terrible service...servers were inattentive and indifferent, the manager bordered on rude. Will never return.",0
Not such a bad place. It has a reputation in some quarters as a sort of Mecca. You'll get good prices on decent Mexican in totally unpretentious surroundings. Not really Mecca,0
they have the best soup. tge salsa is amazing. toasted and roasted and whatnot. i like the taco and soup combo. he likes the coastal trio. yum!!!,0
"We did not have a good experience there.  Contrary to what the Saturn company is supposed to stand for, the salesman we worked with was extremely pushy (even for a used car salesman).  We won't go back.",0
"Paid for 100 Diabetic Syringes for my doggy, Only got 40. Great job there -_-",0
"Great food, reasonable prices!  Small restaurant that could be easily overlooked, make a trip to trader joes and then stop next door st Enzo's!",0
This is a great Asian food store and they have a lot of fresh vegatables.,0
"Well, at least it's cheap. Hot Wok serves a purpose... It makes food court Chinese seem gourmet by comparison. Best part? You don't need to get out of your car.",0
This company will not respond to my complaint that their broken wash wash machinery BROKE MY NEW WINDSHIELD!!!!,0
The happy hour is good but they have t get rid of the old grumpy bartender. Killin the business... We walked out... He apparently thinks he owns the place.. Went to caralbad tavern instead!!!,0
Really Fresh ingredients. I went with the Duckling which had a very unique but pleasantly great taste. I will absolutely go back.,0
Food here is great pretty much everything on the menu is delicious they even have Portuguese beer the desert was very yummy  the waitress was very friendly will be back again,0
Very knowledgeable staff that are willing to answer any question one may have! Great selection of gear and clothing!,0
"Sadly, this place is closed now. Owner moved back to Cali.",0
Super good thin crust!  Sausage shaved on top... so delicious plus they have great hot wings!,0
Oreo donuts tasted pretty good. The baked goods did not give me an orgasm but is a little more fun than dunkin donuts,0
Unless your a celebrity you don't get emailed back. I have a great project wanting to get done with a vintage fridge. So unless tour a celebrity don't waste your time,0
I really liked the large menu variety and all of the vegetarian food but unfortunately my carnivorous husband did not enjoy this place very well. Cozy little place.,0
They put way to much tire dressing on the tires when you drive off it splatters all over the car..\nMade it at 20 after 5,0
Inefficient and discourteous.  Waited over 45 min with no explanation.  Dislike medical offices that think their time is more valuable than their patients.,0
"MOST Honest guys u will find, super helpful and get things done efficiently, cheaply and explain everything! Family owned and Chris, the office manager is awesome!",0
"I used to go here and get a monthly massage with Dan. I like deep tissue and he does a fenominal job. I just couldn't afford the monthly membership anymore, as it gets pricy and forget about regular prices.",0
Light Up Night.  Food has good flavor but doesn't look so hot.  If I hear about the Jackie O desert one more time I'm gonna barf.,0
Great for any occasion. The salty sundae is unusual and fantastic.  The bruschetta addictive.,0
The food was fine but the waitress had too many tables and and the sandwich came long after our drinks were gone 20-30 min. we won't go back!,0
We were carrying many items around and didn't get offer a shopping bag!!! Terrible services!!,0
"Small trendy ultra lounge. Good mix of people, great drink specials for the location and a top quality dj. Not a bad place to hit up for a couple drinks during a nite out.",0
"Pretty dope place for gifts. Pretty tiny space which makes shopping for a gift after work or on the weekend fairly frustrating. But none the less, if you want to get a more unpredictable type of gift and you're in Madison you should stop here",0
"Pedros has an awesome green corn tamales,  there salsa has a unique flavor and includes black olive pieces.  Very reasonable prices and modest decor. Closed on Sunday.",0
My opinion of the food and service has not changed. But they have gotten a bad habit of not opening on time. Sometimes up to 2 hours late!,0
The food and beer are delicious at this restaurant in north Scottsdale. It's a great Father's Day outing!,0
"Ive been coming here since I was a kid..same owner, same quality, same service. EXCELLENT!!!",0

Been here twice. Hate to say it but nothing special. The usual breakfast items but nothing stands out either in preparation or presentation.,0
"Rude, inconsiderate owners who have no business dealing with the public.",0
"Only come here for my automotive needs.  Quick, professional, honest service everytime!",0
I like that it's right downtown by my house.\n\nI dislike that it's mostly vacant.,0
This place is CLOSED  on Sunday October 20. The phone number (both on Yelp and in the door) isn't working and the inside looks empty.,0
Nice bar to grab food and a beer at. Service from bartenders is mediocre. Atmosphere is Irish-feeling but feels kinda meh,0
"Good place for a quick lunch.  Daily lunch specials are pretty good.  Fast, friendly service.  Alphabet soup.",0
This place has horrible service! That's straight to the point! Never coming here again!!!! Not worth the aggravation!!,0
"There pizza is ok, Nooot New York style the slice is too thick.",0

"The food was amazing, personally I didn't like the service. Definitely will be back for the food.",0
Beer selection was fantastic! Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. It's a great place.,0
I hate Walmart in general.... THIS Walmart is the worst. It's always dirty with long lines and disgusting people. I pay 2x more to go to target.,0
Blueberry pancakes were very bland.  No flavor at all.  Excellent service however.,0
I'll keep coming for dinner because the food is worth it,0
The food is good but the service is absolutely HORRIBLE! Took 10 mins to order drinks and an hour to get our food. The waiters are slow and business is under staffed.,0
"The BORDER burger is delish! Onion rings are fantastic. The cookies, though they look bad, are very good! The service is good too.",0
The only thing worse than the food is the service.,0
Cheap but food tasted weird. Would not go back.,0

Words just can't describe Peppi's.... just great food all around.,0
"Great food, fresh and flavorful!  For a chain restaurant its a favorite.",0
Delicious! This is the best gyro place in the C-U and the best gyro place ever. The quality of the food is amazing. The portions are generous and the prices are reasonable.,0
Stopped in here for a quick hand wash.  I had them wash my black car on the side rather than running it through the tunnel.  For $25 not a bad job.  A few swirl marks but overall pretty good.,0
HAIR! Found multiple dark hairs in my fries. Thats just nasty. Service sucks. Seems like the kids working here are are more interested in socializing then taking care of customers. I will not be returning.,0
"I love this airport.  Small enough to get in, around, and out of the airport and large enough to get decent direct flights to most cities.  Parking is cheap but could use more better restaurant options.",0
The best best pizza I've had in the Vegas area so far its in Henderson I suggest to anyone to make a detour to this place this pizza is the bomb salads are the bomb service is the bomb go for it will not be disappointed,0
"I ordered a taco salad, as I was eating it, I almost cracked my tooth on a small rock or pebble. When I called to tell them, they said it was impossible and I must be mistaken. Ridiculous.",0

"Beautiful view, but surely the worst meal i have ever had. My eggs rancheros had no flavor! How is that possible?? And Scott's Benedict was so bland! These cooks clearly hate their jobs and are surely sabotaging it.",0
Great dry cleaner -- quality work a friendly service.  Mike usually runs the counter and is very helpful.  The drive through is a big plus.,0

"It was okay to me. But I would love to come here to try it again. Got green tea bubble and this strawberry thing with loke grass jello, pudding.",0
I had a bad experience here. The 2 women behind the counter were very rude and kept rolling their eyes at me. I was very offended. I will be taking my business somewhere else next time. so disappointing.,0
Nice place to sit with some wine and people watch.  It was packed with students the day I went and it was a great time.,0
"Go in October so you can get the Pumpkin Porter! Also, they have the best french fries in all of Phoenix. Filling up a growler is just $10.... do it!",0
Great food!  Loved their Irish stew. The staff is friendly and the decor is cute but not hokey.,0
"I'm drunk, I come here and order a hot and spicy (sub The mannaise  with Mac sauce) and 2 breakfast burritos. Tell me why I didn't get any hot and spicy??? What the fudge???",0
"Can't beat those prices! With some of the power tools, you get what you pay for, but you can buy a crazy cheap warranty, and take it back if it breaks.",0
Decent airport easy to navigate through. Slot machines are readily available giving you that Vegas vibe!,0
"It's ok generally. Fish taco is nice. But it's not a good place for steak. I ordered filet. She cooked it well, but u still can tell its not like fresh filet, more like frozen filet.",0
"Local chinese food, fit for a king.\nFood portions are huge, for little money.\n\nLove this place.",0
Food is good but not the waitresses.  Phyco waitress won't refill your coffee.  Weekend waitresses are to busy gabbing about their personal life's.     Service not good,0
This was just a fabulous restaurant - very intimiate - wonderful menu selection - great service - and just an overall great experience - strongly recommend listening to the staff  - they have great recommendations and great insight,0
The atmosphere here is pretty nice for a weekend dinner. The massive TVs always have a good game on to watch. The food is pretty good but not amazing. The pasta was decent. The pizza is there area they shine.,0
I'm sorry but this pizza is not worth $15....plain and simple. Go spend your money somewhere else.,0
Service was horrible our waitress was jackie food is good everything took forever to get to the table and people sat down after us and ordered more food and got the food and drinks before us,0
I just called for a quote to clean windows and base boards. The lady who I spoke with was hard to talk to and then hung up when I decided not to go with them.,0
One of the best Mexican places around. The owner always greats you with a smile. Lately it has been kinda a hit and miss. But still good. Sunday Brunch is always fun.,0
"Fast, fresh, delicious...how can I not love it?",0
Nothing special. the food I thought was too greasy and its definitely not an authentic place. Only went once and not going back,0
"Steak was good, sides were jus O.K. The waitress was hot, that always helps. The service was excellent, the food is average and kind of expensive for what it is.",0
Just enjoyed a wonderful dinner this evening. The Salmon over fresh vegetables and linguini along with a glass of wine was a great way to end the work day.,0
"I had a ton of citrus that needed trimmed, these guys were able to finish the job in one day. Very pleased with the finished product. Thought the price was very reasonable.",0
"This place has legit beer and good food.  The atmosphere is a little noisy, but it's a fun place that I'll definitely re-visit!",0
I have had very poor experiences dealing with this business.  Period.,0
Purchased a groupon for this place.  The service was excellent and the deluxe prime rib sandwich and the chipolte burger were fantastic.  You can bet we will visit again wifalsethout,0
"Do not stay here. Awful. As though it's not shabby enough with the slowest \""service\"" in the daytime, a never-ending emergency alarm starts going off at 430  AM. False Alarm.",0
"The sign says: \""Closed 5/14 - 10/25\""",0
Take it from me; avoid this place at all cost.  The only time I go is when I am starved and don't have the energy to cook or get edible food.  And then after I have been kicking myself.,0
"Friendly staff, and a great scratch free car wash at an awesome price!",0
"My husband and I both ordered pasta, and we both ended up with food poisoning, the sauce was super salty and, something was cross contaminated or under cooked for as sick as we both ended up.",0
"Convenient, and clean some things are more pricey than other stores.",0
"Great salad bar and service, but everything else is terrible.  Do not waste your money!!!",0
music can be a lot of fun. food not so good,0
"It is an ok indian restaurant, the quality is not vwry low but it is alao not high at all",0

"had dinner there 12-13 it was terrible,chicken wings were barely cooked& took foreever and the place was not crowded.I dont know whats going on but they are an f on my list will never go ther again!!!",0
"This place is fantastic! Great food, and I love Kiltlifter. It is one of the only beers I will order when I go out, to four peaks or otherwise. Burger was great, bacon on it was cooked splendedly",0
I have yet to find a dish I like there. I feel like there are better places for Mexican besides here. Food was mediocre I thought.,0
"Disappointing food, little high priced for what you get.",0
"This \""pizza\"" was the worst food I have ever eaten.",0
I ended up paying 1k for a crown that they said would be covered by my insurance. Then they billed me $50 for not going back to them.,0
My husband and I tried this place a week or two ago and LOVED IT! Everyone was nice and it was busier than we thought. Didn't take long to get our food. AHHH ITS SO GOOD!,0
Build the Rancheria in Rohnert Park CA! please soon.  just the memory of OJ getting busted here is worth another visit.,0
This is an excellent agency.  From what I've seen they treat their homeless population with respect and dignity.  Volunteer here just once and all the stereotypes that you may have once had about the homeless will quickly be proven wrong.,0
Quicky breakfast. really an upscale denny's. Not spectacular but not awful either. Yeah they have pie.,0
"The food is great, and when they say \""hot,\"" they genuinely mean it. The maximum star rating made me cry into my food. This has never happened in any other Madison restaurant.",0
"Although our server was great and the hottest one there, the rest were very rude. Really did not live up to the hype we were looking forward to.  Food OK.",0
I ate here yesterday and I have food poisoning today. Enough said.,0
Amazing tour with a guide that was very knowledgeable and entertaining. The prize of the 90 Minute tour was a bit steep but well worth it after the fact. I will be back for the shelter tour.,0
OK Mexican dishes. Not authentic but good and tasty. Quick fix if your in that neighborhood.,0
"Big theatre, stadium type seating.  Service is good.  Pretty \""run of the mill\"".",0
Got a ham from them for my employees and they just loved it so much they brought me some.  Plan on going back soon.,0
Ate here twice.  Thought it was dirty and didn't find the food very good at all.,0
Update -- went back here and got the lamb (#2 I think) and it was just okay...stick to the vegetarian sampler platter.,0
"I loved the ambiance. Well decorated and fancy white table cloth. \n\nI ordered the veal, but wasn't that impressed with the lunch prices. I would try other options next time for sure.",0
Service was very friendly. But this location needs a deep cleaning. It is very dirty with dirty bathrooms. Cleanliness is not a priority for this location,0
One of my favorite spots in Charlotte. You can't beat the blackened mahi tacos.,0
I always get great service and find deals at Sunflower.  Great place to shop!!,0
Terrible sound. Terrible lighting. Screens cut out half way through the encore but that really didn't bother me bc it was bad quality anyway.\nGood job on making a Yeah Yeah Yeahs show suck.,0
"Had my car repaired and they are very reasonable priced, honest and fixed the you car right the first time.  Awesome customer service and a great place to get any European car fixed.  I highly recommend them.",0
"Terrible. Long wait, food was a mess and unappealing. One of the worst places I've been.",0
Overpriced.  Food is mediocre.  Service is mediocre.  Atmosphere is confused- is it classy? Warm and rustic?  View is amazing.,0
"Great shop Chinese herbs, etc. They have dried abalone and will slice it for you.  Abalone is expensive,  but worth it.\nOwner is very helpful and answered all of our questions. Will be back!!",0
"I had to throw my food away it smelled so rancid from the Greece. The staff was not helpful, and when I went to cash into my bonus points they said I spent it. What a rip off. Never again!",0
"All you can eat special is a great buy. Food is served hot and accurately cooked to order. Service is very friendly. Nothing fancy, good comfort food better than fast food.",0
Great bartenders cheap beer and pool and awesome local music!,0
"Its an Airport, it is okay but not the speediest to get out of.",0
Craving New Orleans? Come here! Great food and probably the best French fries you will ever have!,0
"Very attractive waitresses, but this is Tempe, so you can find that at Denny's!  Overall a decent scene if you're comfortable hanging out with tthe college crowd.",0
Food is delicious but they take for ever to bring the food. We been waiting for 1hr.,0
Close to home and 2 can dine for $20 bucks. Can't beat that. Good variety of food and great prices.,0
Wow. Ordered 3 dishes - all great. Blueberry muffins and the press tuna sandwich is to die for. I'm digging this place - perhaps my top 3 breakfast joint worldwide.,0
"Absolutely love this restaurant, excellent food and prices! Try the red lentil soup!",0
"I listen to this station throughout the day, but transplanting from Sacramento in Vegas it was nice to be able to listen to Mark and Mercedes. I think they are hilarious and it is not the normal morning talk show that just babbles...",0
Steak was good. Chicken was chewy. Service was great. Price not bad. I've had much better for the price.,0
Great place to get an authentic meal. Great wine selection with generous portions. The house dressing is to die for.,0
"The seats are ridiculous. I am 6'0\""and my boyfriend is 6'3\"" and we barely fit.  This place needs to be redone for tall people.  It's not like humans are getting shorter?",0
Selection was limited and the styles were all ghetto. The worst part is that the salespeople are rude and don't even bother to greet me when I'm standing right in front of them and they didn't even have any other customers there!!!,0
Food was good bar food. Had the wings and the nachos. Service was horrible. The bartender had to pickup the slack for our worthless waitress.,0
"awful, place full of flies, food is not good.",0
"Service was great, Food was excellent...the down side was the tables were dirty! The place only had one table in use when we arrived!",0
"The Elbow Room exceeded my expectations.  The Novemburger was creative and flavor full.  Lunch time on a Saturday seemed quiet though, and the ambiance seemed to be lacking a certain something.",0
Cheap and delicious!  Can't beat that.,0
Great environments! Only downside is service is a bit slow!,0
Currently taking lessons from Nick O. And having a blast learning how to play guitar. Nick is great at determining how well I've progressed through the week and through practice. Very talented guitarist and very skilled instructor.,0
Delicious food!  Well worth the wait.,0
The staff is nice the place is nice but it is WAY overpriced.  They take advantage of people in emotional states and pick their pockets.  Also way under staffed for emergcies,0
This place is dated. The bar improvements look nice if the temperature wasn't sweltering...the monitors are old too. I'd much rather go to the alley on Scottsdale and Thomas.,0
"Not so bad, and definitely not traditional bar food. That said, we opt for better food in the downtown area.",0
"Super duper friendly service, but I am here to eat, and it is mediocore food at best.",0
This place closed back around the first of the year.  Very sorry to see them go.,0
The have a good sushi happy hour here. The service us good at this location compared to others. Worth giving a shot.,0
My husband and I had been here several years before and had a lovely dinner. Unfortunately that was not the case this time around. The service was poor and the food very bland. The two stars are for the view.,0
"Great service and great work! They do take a little while, but if you plan for it and its not a big deal at all. But the customer service it was very good.",0
"Sweet little shop - great place to take the kiddos, and nice to see a huge selection of hand dipped cones and it's a nice departure from the yogurt bars.",0
"This place is great. Great food & beer, lots of machines to play.and a large amount of TVs for your viewing pleasure",0
"good finds, i found a tie that was 2.00 on sale looked brand new, i looked it up , it was going for $125.00 so you should go and just see what they have...",0
Tasty Chinese food!..Pretty good service with nice music...,0
Great food and atmosphere. Small portion for the price though...,0
"Didn't answer the phone the first time. The second time they answered to tell me they were closed, despite me calling at 1pm which is during their business hours.\n\nI'll spend my money else where.",0
Nice view.... Nobody here.... And service is not that great. Have to wait for drinks.  Food service slow as well. VERY average.,0
"If you're looking for a great corner dive with interesting folks, witty bartenders, decent bar food, cheap drinks, low drama, and weekly sex trivia, you found it.",0
I (like others) am at a loss as to why this place has such a good overall review. tasteless and awful,0
Food is ok for the price. Menu never changes though. Can get boring.,0
I love the atmosphere and the food. Not a fan of beer or wine as my only options. And I hate forced valet parking. If it weren't for the forced valet parking I would visit more often.,0
Didn't care for our square fish or the sauce. Both of us ended up feeling and getting sick that night.  I won't be returning.  I don't understand the appeal at all.,0
"It is completely and totally awful.  The food is hideous.  Don't go there, you will thank me.",0
Such a fun place!!! Food is delicious. Bottom line. Make sure to share sides so you get to try them all! Drinks are sugar filled in giant mason jars and chicken is juicy. Love the atmosphere and very worth the wait!,0
Meh. That's about all I will write.,0
Great place for a busy and aged hotel; the nicest part is it's in open lobby with a waterfall and cute shops!,0
30 minutes is just too long to wait for wings and it still didn't look like my order was coming so no thanks.,0
"My boy is getting his junk snipped!!!! 40 min,",0
Customer service is horrible at this location..The manager doesn't even speak when u walk in and she could be standing right in front..,0
"Amazing food and beer! This is a great place to go for dinner, a date, or just a night out with friends. It's always packed so you need to park a little far away, but it's worth it.",0
"Service was not good, they forgot about us after our dinner was served. Chips tasted stale.",0
"Food was good, however this Is primarily an outdoor seating place and for some reason they allow smoking at the outdoor bar.  It is a problem.  If smoking bothers you avoid this place.",0
As fast food goes this is a pretty good option. Love the original roast beef sandwich with Arby's sauce!!!,0
If you want PHO in Pittsburgh (Considering the Vietnamese Restaurant selections) I would choose this Place over Tram's Kitchen. The Pho here is more fragrant.,0
It's getting better as the new owners remodel and get in some new tenants.,0
"I have been going here for years.  Little Mom and Pop shop.  Great sandwiches, especially the Super Sicilian.  Can get noisy during lunch hours.  Very good food, would highly recommend it.",0
"Hands down, best fried chicken in Charlotte, NC!",0
Great place to take the kids! Buy the ticket pack for rides. great place to picnic and spend the day.,0
There was a lot of food for $6.   Love the Hatch chiles. So good and I am stuffed!!!,0
Ignored the reviews here. Went anyway. Now I regret it.,0
Great Thai! Last visit I ordered the green curry and will again. It's a bit overly cozy for romantic date night but the perfect place for lunch with my daughter.,0
I loved this place. We are visiting Phoenix and needed my nails done. Mine were chipped etc.  Loved this shop. I have very pretty flowers on my toes.  Price was very low and my  satisfaction is very high.,0
I love love love their meat! They must sprinkle it with crack or something cus those sandwiches are addicting lol,0
"Took my Daddy here to get his beard trimmed and while they did a fairly decent job of the cut, Victoria needs to learn a little customer service (and how to even out a mustache properly!)",0
"the atmosphere, homemade vegetables, and drink specials sealed the deal for me.\n\nthe cornbread not so much, could use some more salt and flavor.",0
"we were in town for 3 nights and ended up eating here twice great bar food exactly what i expect, what more can a guy ask for!",0
"Came here for breakfast and the food was great. I had bacon, eggs, hash browns, and toast for only $5. The bacon was excellent quality and everything was cooked to perfection. I'll be back again!",0
So far taking four times to fix patio door that they just put new rollers on an had to cut a little off the top. Would not recommend these people unless you want to keep calling them back.,0
Still have not returned my cc deposit $200 after 4 days! Pissed! Avoid Hertz if you are trying to speak to a human!,0
Good food and Ice cool beer! what more can you ask for. the chilie is awsome,0
Beautiful day for outdoor dining.  We were early for dinner - they were not yet busy. Our service and food were good and we will return on our next visit to the Phoenix area.,0
"I love this place beyond words.  They have a good selection of vegan food, and their fake meat is awesome.The soynamis and oatmeal cookies are amazing.  Can't recommend it enough.",0
I have been using them for years! Wonderful work and great attention to detail.,0
How can you complain when it's all a DOLLAR? I love this place!!! A dollar a hollar! Yeah!,0
"You are nasty Pete, especially here in Tempe.  Fast food, that doesn't come out that fast, served by greasy staff in a greasy space.",0
Never...ever...again. There is too much other good food around town.,0
Great staff and phenomenal dentists. They really care about their patients!!!,0
Okay I like this place but prices have gotten higher... And the man that works here always looks at everyone like they are going to steal or something! It not like I wanna pocket a 2 dollar nail art! Customer service sucks,0
Are you kidding? The food was below average and overpriced and there were flies buzzing around the salsa bar.  You have got to go to Carolina's on Cactus Rd. and Cave Creek.,0
Dinner with friends on valentines day - food pricing absurd - service lousy. Many better choices.,0
Decent food for a bar.  Very small place so you have no choice but to listen to the idiots at the bar.  Service was OK.,0
"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. The food is consistently excellent and VERY reasonably priced. I especially love the cheese pie and baked kibbee, but everything on the menu is pretty delicious!",0
Awesome awesome awesome!!!! Do yourself  a favor & go experience the Detroit red wings you won't regret it.,0
Three stars is about right.  Its okay but not memorable.  The atmosphere was fun though and lively.,0
"No more salad bar, what a joke. It would be nice to see new owners for this place that cared for customer service. Hate to say it but must, typical Buckeye.",0
Pretty cool little biker bar.  Food was good typical bar portions with pretty standard bar.  It has a very large outside patio which I am sure make it the go to spot in the Arizona summer heat.,0
"Meatball sub horrible,little rocks of meat? Never again",0
"Best pizza in Las Vegas.   It's the only pizza that I've found to be comparable to New York Pizza.  Also the calzones are great and made to order, not pre-made and gross.",0
Very small restaurant.  Chips and salsa are tasty.  Would not recommend the steak.  Portions are very good.,0
"Best service in town, maybe in the world.  This newly blossoming empire around town also serves up the ultimate hangover cure, especially when complimented by a Propel.  Store that fact away, it's a useful one.",0
Decided to stop in after reading all of the wonderful reviews was extremely disappointed the meal was so awful I didn't even attempt to finish it money wasted!!,0
Please clean your floor properly.  It feels like Crisco under your feet.  Very dangerous.,0
Absolutely grotesque. I honestly cannot believe people come back after eating here. Worse than Little Caesars.,0
"Waited 15 minutes when it was empty only to be told, \""Sit where you want if you still want to eat here.\"" Food was room temperature. Toast had mold on it. Worst Denny's ever!",0
"My favorite for Pt. Breeze/Pittsburgh East End. Flat New York style, not greasy, timely delivery, they know my orders!",0
"There is a juicy bar behind the main door, They have many many different smoothies. Soo great I never tried it before it's incredible and fresh I have tried the coconut milk with mango and pineapple, so glad that I saw it...",0
Food is pretty good. Solid cheap Chinese take out.,0
Salon is hit or miss depending on who does your nails.  Last time that I went one nail wasn't even completely polished and the ends had not been filed smooth.  They are cheap but you get what you pay for.,0
"We eat here a couple of time a month, the food is always good and the service is good.  The lunch prices are great for a sit-down.",0
"Carmen's came highly recommended, & now I will recommend them to EVERYONE!!! Fast, friendly, honest!!!",0
"When I am having a sugar craving after busting out a gargantuan trail run, I hit this place up. Muffins, cupcakes, all sorts of gluttony inducing items.",0
Hard to find its in a residential area in the north west good old fashioned las vegas steak house worth the trip from Henderson though.,0
Hooters degrades us.\nTheir use of big breasts is gross.\nI go for the wings.,0
"Nothing authentic about this place. Horchata was horrible, they are better off buying the pre-made stuff.",0
"Pancakes, pancakes, pancakes.  Everybody told me I HAD to try and their pancakes.\nWell, the short stack they served me were lousy pancakes.",0
"Will not come back...  this place has no windows? Decoration is outdated. Looks scary in there. Food, I didn't like.",0
"Had a great dinner there tonight. Clean, friendly, great deal on delicious food. Good sized portions for a great price. We will definitely go back soon.",0
Be prepared to wait at least an hour in the waiting room and another hour in the doctors room. I gave them a second chance and still waited 2 hours. And they have the nerve to charge you for missing an appointment?!?,0
Staff worked hard to accomodate my party of 44. Service was fast. Food was delicious. Could have cut my filet mignon with a butter knife.,0
Been here twice and both times had to wait forever for our food even though the place was dead. Food is good if you have the time to wait.,0
"Great stay. Great staff. Clean rooms, ample parking, well appointed suite style rooms that felt spacious. Perfect stay for out of town business and meeting with clients.\n\nWould come back.",0
I've been coming to this location for over 2 years. I have had only fantastic service experiences. Never a bad one!!! They make excellent drinks too! True artisans that know their craft well. Solid!,0
My bud and I have enjoyed the table for years. We had breakfast there today and whatever they have done to their corn beef hash is disappointing and one of the worst breakfast mealsI have ever had. The service is slow and unorganized.,0
Dirty location. I ordered a sweet tea for them to tell me they are out after I paid for my order. And refused to refund me. I don't drink soda.,0
"Amazing food, amazing views. Great secret date place.",0
"This a a quinsential hole in the wall. But the food is really really goid, as are the beers.",0
"Terrible service, and I ordered a items that were advertised as 8.99 but I was charged 11.99. Manager claimed that he was unable to change price in computer..what a joke. I will never go to that location again!",0
Great place for a drink after work.  Killer bar food.  The mac and cheese is to die for.,0
"It is unfortunate that this is closing, as it is the best fine dining in Madison.   I think that a lot of people don't recognize that they also have a smaller bar area with more affordable options that are excellent as well.",0
"Ive been coming here since they first opened. Anthem didn't even exist. Of course, Im gonna say it, I love the outlet store :) This outlet is where I get all my cookware.  Excellent quality at bargain prices.",0
"I like it, I don't love it and I don't have to have it but once in a while its nice to please my sweet tooth.  There are so many different combos of cream you can mix and match.",0
I am thinking people are writing reviews for the atmosphere and not the food.  The food is not good.  You go for the adventure of it but not the food.,0
Great theater!!! Absolutely beautiful.. Live the seating... Seen Book of Mormon here!!! Loved it,0
Update: The Morning Bun is divine and made my morning extra happy. That's all.,0
seriously? concierge service and tip jars in the bathrooms? but what happens if no one tips? (shudder),0
"People here are so mean especially the workers, when me and my boyfriend came here they were making fun of us cos we' re gay. I would never ever come back here anymore.",0
"Disappointed. Food was awful, not good at all. Tried it once and probably will not come back again. I will go else where for real quality food. Service was blah. Overall, not a good experience. No thank you!",0
I've had the exact opposite experience at this branch as previously described by the other individual. Had my general banking needs can be taken care of without issue.\n\nI'm guessing something might have changed in the past year.,0
Chicken and Dumplings were fantastic...great feel.  Awesome place for lunch. Fast efficient service.,0
"The worst experience in eating out.  Worst food, restaurant owner from hell, rude and grumpy.  Will never set foot in that place again.",0
Poor customers service.  They will take an hour to come and pick you up or send you a cab that is smaller than your request.  Basically they suck,0
The bagels are good. The sandwiches leave something to be desired in the taste department and the coffee is over roasted. Everything is a bit over-priced for what you get. I have never had a problem with the customer service.,0
Crappiest service ever! If they is even a remote chance you may return something go somewhere else or look at every bit of fine print on your receipt. Never shopping at a Radio Shack again!,0
"Very nice service, beautiful restaurant.  The food was ok, for those prices I expected it to be much better.  I probably would not eat here again.  Unless I won the lottery.",0
"I went in to get a shampoo, wow NO help at all!! They didnt even ask me if I needed help or even greeted me. The two employees were just gossiping in the back room. Got out of there and never coming back!",0
"they always book crappy music there.\nit is a nice place, but it is week as hell.\nget some 13 to the gallows, or wayne hancock or something in there.",0
"Please see my other review for Summerlin Hospital. Again, there are 2 Yelp pages for the same business.  When I checked in I guess it checked into a different one. :)",0
Nice place to visit in spring time frame.  The prices are affordable and the views are breathtaking.,0
"Decent priced all-you-can-eat and great saki specials (weekdays). The atmosphere is a little drab though. And the music was a trip down memory lane, ha!",0
"Have been to this Good Egg many times, the food never disappoints. Great place for breakfast or lunch and even coffee!",0
"Don't bother with this company, he was scheduled to do work for me and was a no call, no show and won't answer his phone.",0
Great dive bar!  Great when they have live music.,0
Went there this past weekend and had Steak & Lobster. Really love the taste of the food and customer service was great.,0
You can't get in touch with anyone in corporate? Then you know something is up,0
"Security was much improved, though I'm sure that was partly due to the Sunday morning departure.  I'll take it though.",0
"Great location, great view and good food. The customer service is top notch too.",0
"A damn good, real burger!  Totally worth dropping in... great cheeseburger and the generous portion of fries had to be shared among 4 adults!",0
"Food was passable, while service was tolerable. Out of steak sauce? Really. Double fries looked barely enough for a single order of fries.  Then they charged us twice!",0
Good for a fast lunch. Had the gyro and added feta. Gyro was fine. Bottle of coke had icy slush in it.,0
"Really cute furniture and accessories shop in downtown Mesa. \n\nIt's a fun place to stroll around and discover a new scent of candle or a must-have home decor item. The have some nice local artwork, too.",0
"Great subs lots of food. Italian stallion was great. Small ma and pa deli, you won't be disappointed.",0
"They were supposed to design and  build our booth, a big one. TWO weeks before the event they said they could not work on it and did not have anything ready. I would not recommend working with them.",0
Friendly staff.\nFast check-out. \nGreat selection.,0
Had breakfast with my son today and it was a great experience. Kathleen was a great server and made us laugh. Quick and friendly service.  Great food. Will be back.,0
This place is horrible. The service is second rate and the estimates are through the roof. A poorly run company by poorly organized people,0
They have the friendliest staff around. I hope they stay the same under the new ownership!!!!!\n\nGood luck guys...,0
"Fifteen minutes no server they aren't that busy, no management at all this is by far the worst I've been to, just want some breakfast late in the day",0
"My first time here, this salon came highly recommended. I'll definitely be back when i'm in town! Clean space and friendly staff and prices are reasonable. My pedi and mani were thorough and delightful.",0
"Defiantly one of my favorite pizza places I've tried so far while being in the shadyside area. The crust was cooked to perfection, perfect amount of sauce on the pizza and the cheese was glorious! I loved it!",0
Always good. My daughter loves it! Matthews location has great customer service!,0
Went here for 1-year anniversary. Over-priced food where 50 and 60 year old townies and professors eat.\n\nYou've been warned.,0
"Bad place to eat, tastes like dog food, bland and no taste, I swear they use canned dog food or some garbage, this place I will never go to again!",0
Food was great once we got it. Cooks missed up/ skipped our ticket so it took more time to get our food. Server was nice.,0
Fast and friendly. Couldn't ask for more.\n\nWhy aren't there more coffee shops around here?!,0
This place is chock full of everything to create a masterpiece.  Other decorative things are available if you need to paint a masterpiece or just decorate a room or get ready for an event  =) check it out!,0
I love these guys. Props to Michael! \nBest service and so honest,0
"I was there on my lunch hour and the only client. I asked for specific additions to the pedicure, they delivered on what I asked. I had a great experience.",0
"The wings are great! I prefer the hot wings.\n\nThe rest of the menu varies. Sometimes their burgers are really good, but it seems it changes sometimes..\n\nThe wings are always good, though.",0
I leave it for them to do.\n\nGreat folks. Great service. Fair prices. Can't ask for more!,0
"Food is good, service and cleanliness need major improvement. Teen staff mostly ate and was clueless to the customer,\nMoire mature servers, steam clean the place, would be a great experience.",0
Great food. Restaurant is undergoing renovation - but don't let that stop you from going there.,0
Very good breakfast. You can tell a lot of care is taken with the food. Very friendly staff and nice casual atmosphere.,0
Fares keep going up. Another service cut this month. I think I'd rather walk to work in the middle of the night!,0
I had the raspberry cheesecake for dessert yesterday.  Wow!!!  Good stuff.  My mom had the baklava-very nutty if you like baklava. It was like eating desserts on steroids!,0
Very disappointed!!\nOne of the worst service i ever experience. So incomplete n rude waiters,0
"This is the best hotel in Downtown for sure. It's very luxurious and has a great layout.  With being on the center of Freemont Street and tons of bars and dining options, this is the place to be at when Downtown.",0
"The Superstition Mountains are a great way to get out of the city and enjoy Arizona. Lots of saguaro on ocotillo, with all kinds of trails for all kinds of hikers. A must see when you're in Phoenix!",0
Food was great but the service was subpar and it wasn't too busy.  This is a great locals spot without a long wait which is why we love it.\nThe bread basket is by far the highlight!,0
"This. Place. Sucks. The food is bad, the waitresses are nasty (and they suck at their job), it's full of a bunch of overweight degenerates in NASCAR shirts... Just bad all the way around.",0
"I come in here every so often to make deposits for family member.  The folks there have been very friendly and I have not had any problems.  So, all is good so far...",0
"This is a family tradition for me......... breakfast everytime I come home to visit the parents.  \nClassic midwestern diner, in the middle of the desert.\nLoved the corn beef hash.",0
"Best sports bar ever! Thanks to John S., I will never eat wings anywhere else again... Their Giovanni wings are the best wings I have ever had.\n\nKeep up the good work Santisi Bros!",0
Good food and selection. My husband and I eat here fairly regularly. I love their salsa and the atmosphere is great,0
Good prices and they do a great job.  Now if only they'd stay open late enough so that I could go after work instead of making me wait on the weekend.,0
Fast! Repaired three mangled pairs of glasses in under 10 minutes for under $20. Great service and super fast!,0
This place is not very good. They only gave us three side dishes and they were not great. Kimchi pancake was not good at all. Pork Bulgogi was decent.,0
They do a good job. Best in the area. Student grooms save you $,0
This was my third time eating here and by far the best. Everything was perfectly prepared but the best of all was our waiter Sal. He was perfectly attentive without being invasive and made the evening the best ever! Thanks Sal,0
"Great service, but this is honestly the worst food I have ever eaten out at a restaurant in my life. I dont suggest going here for food EVER (maybe for the drink specials and hookah but nothing else).",0
Great place! Friendly staff. Good music and awesome beer selection. I reco Bells two hearted ale!,0
"very good food.  excellent service!  eggs benedict is the specialty here and it's excellent.  decent coffee and a great view of the tarmac, right outside the window.",0
Great place for happy hour. Only four stars cuz the service is always hit or miss but the food has always been choice..,0
Disgusting!!!!! i saw one people at the front door who seat guests blow his nose into the corner of the resturant onto the floor while he thought nowone was looking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nwe got up and left.,0
I got what I expected...a smog test for $9.99. It may not be a purrfect auto repair place but it's way cheaper than any other smog test in Las Vegas.,0
"Sauce good, but minimal meat toppings on our pizza. Expensive drinks and beer.",0
"Delivery was extremely fast (ordered at 3 and they were here at 3:20) and meal was still warm! I got the plain chicken sandwich and it's delicious. Also, I Loved the candy that came with it!",0
"The best in family resturants!  Great diverse menu,  wonderful service, and game room for the kids.  I choose this place for a night out with or without kids.",0
If you haven't been here drop everything and go.  Great food at a reasonable price!  Plates big enough to share or have the next day,0
"Room 241 this time.  Octagonal room, very comfortable.  Nice.",0
Uri and Steve are awesome. Great watches to custom priced right engagement rings. They are the best. Check them out!!,0
Chicken chimichanga very good nice and moist chicken. Chicken fajitas very good and full after eating,0
"Great food and the service is always GREAT, however it is a bit pricey. Maybe not the best place for kids",0
"Great food, great beer, great televisions and great service.  \n\nThat about covers it.\n\nOh and they have Golden Tee.  Get the appetizer sampler.",0
Beer was good but food was mediocre at best. I will not be going there ever again because I did not feel welcome. Not impressed with service.,0
Two out of the three times that I have been here I have had a bad experience. My pedicure came out looking textured. It was a complete waste of money. I will not be going back.,0
This is one of those stereotypical sit down Chinese restaurants that feature an eclectic menu. There's nothing really special besides the free tea. I will say that the fried rice dish wasn't enough to get me full sadly.,0
So many good items the worst part about this place is deciding what to get lol hehe! :-)\n\nRemember your appetite ;),0
Had green burrito with pork.  Excellent! Not fatty. \nDaughter had taquitos.  Loved them.,0
This used to be a fav but last few experiences both food and service have been terrible. Will miss this place after being a dedicated patron for 15 years.,0
Ok subs I'd rather have a hot sub fire house.,0
Oh my goodness I absolutely love this place! Strawberry hotcakes have brown sugar creme cheese and whipped cream! Also love the chorizo sausage with eggs n hash! Fresh strawberries year round wonderfully delicious!,0
"I won't go anywhere else to get my piercings. trevor is absolutely amazing. he's professional, awesome, knows his stuff.",0
I refuse to eat at a restaurant where you stole 98% of your menu from another restaurant and just changed the names!  Shame.\n\nWish I could give zero stars,0
"If you are looking for a cool, outdoor bar with things to do close by, look no further.  Just blocks from the Saturday Flea Market, this quaint and relaxing bar has great appetizer options as well as a great cocktail menu.",0
"Some of the best wings I've ever had! The hot are my fav, and the staff is always friendly!",0
This was the doctor's office I used all throughout college. I was not very satisfied on many occasions and they actually mis-diagnosed my friend and gave her the wrong mediction. I guess that is what you get on a college campus!,0
"This is fast food Chinese. Most dishes are deep fried but it's quick and reasonably priced. Best dishes are orange chicken  being beef and king pay chicken,  add a little chow me in and you have a  De ent meal",0
Another fantastic place on the east side.  I love to pick up a dozen for my colleagues on my way to work!!!,0
"Terrible quality work and ruined my repair work prior to painting. Left lights loose, ruined my lock. Rip off don't go here.",0
Excellent!!! Like being in Italy!  So quaint and owners so caring.  Loved the house salad dressing!,0
"Great service! terrible food, a shame.  The Ceasar salad had the wrong type of lettuce, wrong dressing. Came with tomatos!  Lasagna bland and mushy!  And why. The Tv??!",0
"Very honest, competent staff. Would not go anywhere else. They always are fair and will try to save you money if possible.",0
Still great. I forget how good they are and wonder why it goes so long between visits. \n\nService was slow and forgetful but once you eat you forget about it.,0
"Ok pizza. I like Glass Nickel a little better, but this is pretty good. Great delivery service (fast). This is on Monona drive. The address on Yelp is their old address.",0
"My chai wasn't as tasty as other places, but was drinkable. Friend said that it is not her experience...maybe a bad make.",0
Love this place! Great food with big portion size and we love the beer!,0
Worst moving company of all time damaged just about everything never use them!,0
"Thank you for a memorable evening of great people, delicious food, wonderful wine and being made to feel like we were old friends. Will definitely be back on our next trip.",0
I like it more for hanging out and having a pint.,0
Great place! Very friendly people and a huge selection. Nice to see birds not in cages.,0
A good resort for a quick staycation or getting away!!!,0
"Can't go wrong here, excellent every time! Great pizza, keep up the good work.",0
"Pretty good neighborhood bar! Even at 10am on a Sunday morning! Great wings, and good wraps. They have live music on the weekends...something that's going away at most places.",0
"Great Thai food - ambiance is great, good service, great food!",0
The only good thing is the cheesecake. The food is terribly mediocre. And I hate how they seem to all be decorated like ruins of some sort. I want some damn food not an expedition with Fernando!,0
This place is amazing. I adore the Chicken Katsu but everything on the menu is good! The owner is lovely and they work really hard and do a great job!,0
They raised the prices on the machines by a quarter.  There still aren't enough laundry carts to go around. There are like only 7 in the entire laundromat. When it's packed it's every man for himself.,0
"Food was good, service was ok.  Nothing bad to write about, but nothing outstanding either.  Decently priced and tasty.",0
"The food at this place is amazing. Blows olive garden away Big Time. So far best Italian restaurant in Phoenix. Great food, great atmosphere. Only draw back is it's a little small. Other than that would of been 5 star",0
"All I want to say about this place is.....\n\nThe pizza was finger lickin' good.\nThe Salad was awesome.\nThe House dressing was very, very good.\n\nI want MORE!!!",0
"Very friendly place. I go for breakfasts and other than the very dry cooked hash browns, the food is good.  Prices very reasonable.",0
Stopped in for lunch & it will be the last time.  The food was very mediocre and  unattractive.  My husband had a hot roast beef sandwich & it was very bland. My salad was a little better.,0
"Great little museum, nothing else like it in Las Vegas! Awesome new dinosaurs exhibit with authentic fossils. Definitely worth checking out!",0
"This place is great, unfortunately I have no time to actually sit there and eat but I get my lunch delivered. I'm within walking distance and the food shows up fast, usually within 15 min. Thank you guys!!",0
Recently had them come out to do a pre summer check on my A/C. Were very polite over the phone and in person. Will use next time :-),0
At any time of the day or night I know I can get my favorite soft drink or sweet roll. nice and clean rest rooms.,0
Steak wasn't med rare no server after the food came the manager was wanting to know what I thought only great thing was the bread,0
First time here. Well organized and clean. Very friendly staff. Reasonable prices and large space. Down side... In rough neighborhood. Wouldn't come alone at night and definitely locked my car. Will come again.,0
Great place to eat! Make a reservation on the weekend or you will have to wait!,0
"Great food, great prices. It's really fast and you don't even need to call your order in.",0
"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. This is a lovely, elegant hotel. However the thing that makes it really stand out is the quality of customer service. The staff are simply wonderful - professional, frriendly, attentive.",0
rude drivers.  Skip this cab and take the next one.,0
"Wonderful old-style country French. Dinner combined with restaurant.com a real bargin, allowing a better bottle of wine. Very attentive service, even from the elderly owner. Perfect for that special occaison.",0
"....my hair looks fine, but I swear to God the young lady cutting it was intentionally jabbing me with the sheers.",0
Food is always consistent and tastes decent. Service is kind of blah. The place is kind of dirty and this includes the appearance of the employees. Eh...but its cheap and you get what you pay for.,0
"I agree with most other reviewers... They are pretty darn fast for lunch rush in drive thru, never had a mistake on my order and the people are nice in drive thru. Good for them at serving people the right way.",0
"This is impressively tasteless. I adore Chinese food but this place is really unacceptable, not even mediocre.",0
"Hey, at least the guy didn't ask \""what can we get started for you\"". He knew I just wanted coffee. Medium coffee. Thanks.",0
"They have a nice selection of stuff, but watch there food...I personally found several items past the expiration dates. I forgot to check the hostess donuts bag that I bought and found mold growing in it when I got home.",0
amazing italian food and great service. I can't wait to go back.,0
"The lunch buffet is $6.50, but it is awful.  Horrendous Chinese food. I will not be returning.",0
"This place is dying....years ago, this place was packed of so much stuff.  It used to be cool coming here...so much things to see/look at, now everything looks just like a leftover...Sad.",0
Monti's used to be so good... now it's awful.  The prices have gone up while the food quality has gone done.  Extremely dissapointed.  I wish they would bring back their old menu and food.,0
The showed up when they said they would. Very professional. They checked our AC/Heat pump to make sure it was in working order for the winter. Would do business with again.,0
"Friendly and helpful staff... Extremely convenient location for Old Town and Fifth Street.  Also, a Keurig coffee maker in the room.  A definite bonus for making better \""in room\"" coffee.",0
Great food! Good atmosphere! They also have a 24hr bar attached which serves the same food and has a happy hour.,0
"Sorry, but our pizza was cold.  All nine cuts of it.  And the garlic wings didn't taste like garlic.  Maybe it was an off night?",0
"Bacon, egg, and cheese on a garlic bagel toasted. That's all you need to know.",0
"Canned peas and corn in my soup and curry. No thanks.\n\nCurry was runny and the noodles in my drunken noodles were overcooked and super, super greasy.\n\nI'm disappointed.",0
"Delicious food, great service! Our food was very fresh and hot when it arrived at our table. The wait staff were very friendly and very attentive. Thank you for a pleasant dining experience, we will return.",0
"I ate this food for 10 years until they decided to not deliver my food and not answer the telephone. Do not order from this place. I REPEAT, DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE.",0
Had carne asada plate. It was ok but not the 4-stars I was expecting. Maybe I got the wrong thing (?) The best part was the ginormous and delicious handmade flour tortilla which came with my plate.,0
Great facility! Amazing staff! Dion assisted me and he was so professional! I will be joining this gym! So much to do there! I simply loved racket ball!,0
I had the number 12 to go. I was disappointed with this dish. It was greasy and had too much cheese. It was also fairly bland.,0
If you eat-in it is amazing here! Easily 4 or 5 stars. But when you order delivery the food and service get lousy! So spare yourself the heartache and disappointment and eat in!,0
Definately my kind of place- Diamond in the rough... Fresh seafood... and cheap beer! The food was delicious! I can't wait to go back and try that giant seafood pot!,0
"We must have had invisible paint on!  After the hostess sat us 3-5 waitresses went by and did not even look our way, say Hi or anything!  We left & no one saw us leave!",0
"Avoid this place.  Its super loud, and the weird seating gimmick is a nightmare.  Food was nothing better than average.",0
No more all you can eat. Too expensive for the quality of meat they serve. Beef brisket super tough to chew. Moving on to next spot.,0
Average food. But it us a good place to go for this little kids. Good variety if rides for most ages below 15.,0
I came here from another oil change place that I wasn't happy with. They were nice and honest to me. I had a very pleasant experience. And the oil change literally took 10 min. :),0
"Taste like nasty rye bread bagels. Have had way better, but then again I'm from the East Coast. Go to Dunkin Donuts they're better for a chain that makes bagels.",0
Daniel is an asset to super cuts. I will request him for all future appointments.,0
I like coming here. Saw the Lion King. Bathrooms get crowded so you better hurry.  I'll be back.,0
The Laurel Market is another quaint Charlotte institution that is full of character (and sometimes characters!).  I like the wine section and can always find something new to try.,0
Didn't eat here.  Only had iced tea.  Sat at the bar with a fellow comic and talked for hours.  Service was super friendly.\nThe end.,0
"Great food and service. The price may seem a bit high, but you get a ton of good food! Noise level was good-I could easily converse with my friends.",0
"Food was good service was good, only negative is price",0
Super great stuff. A lot of the metal stuff is actually made there.,0
"I walked in and everyone eating there was Mexican, that's a good sign.  The food and soda were good and so was the service.",0
"Not as good as I remember, but the service is top notch.",0
"Definately not service with a smile. Order is usually wrong, and workers are rude.",0
"What a cool store. It's so trendy and chic that it's almost intimidating! The sales people are chatty and polite, allowing customers to simply 'hang out' on the displayed furniture.",0
We've gone to this Walmart a few times. On our last visit the store was in such disarray that we couldn't find what we were looking.,0
Like a little sam's club but less crowded and more options to buy things. Like a grocery store/costco in one! Love this store,0
I think this place is OK. I believe most people who like it are new to vegitarian-vegan items.,0
Pretty good steak house. Our waiter was friendly and joked around with us. Food was good and came out quick. Dig this place!,0
This place used to be the go to spot. Real Solid for the most part. Now the food is horribly bland and the egg rolls have some spice in them that is super nasty.\n\nSad,0
Great service.  Nice selection.  If everything runs smoothly with my rentals this place will get 5 stars easy.  Ill keep everyone posted.,0
I got food poisoning here. It was the worst experience of my life. Don't eat the chicken!,0
Old School Hot Dog Stand. The staff was very helpful when ordering. The sausage dog was really good. Fries were great. A pleasant experience all around.,0
"meh...........as a native Pittsburgher, I think this place is trendy and overpriced.  I'd rather go to Penn Brewery at the bottom of Troy Hill.",0
"if you are looking for fresh veggies, look elsewhere, their selection is tiny and what they do have is in bad shape.  if you're looking for ingredients to make vietnamese or chinese dinners, then you're in luck",0
Good food usually very consistent....Great bbq shrimp. Seating can be tight.,0
"She's dressed in black and yellow, she says \""Hello,\ncome sit next to me you fine fellow.\""\nYou run over there without a second to lose\nAnd what comes next, Steelers bust a move!!!",0
"This place has everything for the perfect date. They had a guy singing called Big White Cloud? lol He was great, the service was perfect, the outdoor heaters are magical. I will be back!!!!",0
The Supermarket aisles doesnt seem to be to organized. The Employees are friendly. I miss the Ice Cream shop that was inside. The Gas Station is a big conveniece. The prices are good.,0
"Good place to go see a movie, only $7 matinee, not as good of a place to eat. The buffet is lackluster at best, something as simple as bread pudding lacks the flavor you would find in other buffets.",0
"2.9/5 stars - Probably the best of the national \""chain\"" pizza places assuming you order thin crust or the stuffed crust pizza. Pan pizza is a  1/2 cooked pile of dough...",0
"Good thai restaurant, if u r craving thai\nVegetarians have a good number of choices to explore. Good service, good food and okish ambience.",0
During lunchtime. Very good. Chicken soup some of the best I have ever had. The pico great also.,0
Terrible food + terrible service. I won't say much about my experience but its enough to never return.,0
I just ate here yesterday afternoon. I had 3 fish tacos. Today I am suffereing from food poisoning. How lovely.,0
I've only been 1 time an it was for St Patricks Day. It was cool. It could have been much worse.I liked the Irish band that was on and love all the people doing the jig!,0
We won't take our two cars anywhere else. They are honest and the customer service is awesome. That is difficult to find in Las Vegas. I will never service my cars at the dealership again.,0
Food is ok... I think its a bit overpriced though.. Service is good.. Just not a big fan..,0
"The queens here are so rude including the fat ugly ones. If you're looking for bottoms and more bottoms, This is the place for you.",0
30 beers on tap from 30 great brewers.  The cooler has hundreds more in bottles but this place satisfies!  I've been here 20 times for the ale but the service can be weak at times.,0
Nasty & Dirty.  Food is okay.  They do a great steak.  The place is full of regulars drinking cheap beer.,0
"Not much to say here that hasn't being said.  PJ is my staple restaurant for fresh, healthy mediterranean inspired food. Avoid if you don't like crowds though, it's almost always busy.",0
Not impressed. They were busy... I was disappointed in the food. I ordered a shredded beef taco salad and only two bites of meat in the whole salad. Ill try something else if I ever end up there again.,0
"Been through this airport twice now and haven't had any issues. Easy to navigate, indoor smoking areas and slots to while away the time if you are so inclined. Typical food choices and stores. It's an airport what do you expect?",0
Adorable place! Historic building oozing with charm. Food was good and service was great! Full menu including vegan options. Win!,0
Great airport. You can gamble while u wait.,0
"Great customer service at lunch. Order the lunch special and 6 other customers get served before me. Wait 45 minutes then get up to leave. Am asked \""Do I want that to go?\"" Can anyone say @DirtyDrummer?",0
"I place an order and I was put on hold for 25 minutes, crazy, I don't think I will order ever again.",0
"TERRIBLE service from beginning to end. Bad hosts, bad server. It sucks. But the food is ALWAYS amazing. I would deal with shitty service for their awesome food.",0
"Only been to the first floor and food court. Has a variety of businesses in it, banks, coffee shop, restaurant etc. Kinda everybody's memory. \nThe entrance hall is very relaxing with ancient looking clock and couches.",0
Food is good and bread is fresh. But the bathrooms are very dirty. Makes me wonder about the kitchen.,0
ordered food while at work not only did we get about food over an hour late  but i've had better frozen eggrolls than this place and the rice was terrible. Definately have had much better food in the valley.,0
"I ordered delivery from here because of the good reviews. It wasn't gross, but it wasn't good either. I don't understand how all the flavor can be sucked out of thai food. I have definitely had better.",0
"I have eaten here many times, the menu has changed, food is OK.  $1.95 for sour cream, REALLY???  Enough said!  I will not be back.",0
"This place is simply amazing. The food is always so good, the staff is always very friendly and I have a blast whenever I head over there.",0
The burrito platter has a ton of food on it and tastes great. Awesome Hatch Valley Chile too!,0
"As far as campus bars go, this is as good as it gets. A great place to gather with a small group of friends and drink some beer.",0
Place is abandoned and locked down. Phone is out of service.  Still merchants inside just no one to sell it.,0
"best mongolian beef anywhere, swear....",0

My daughter and I had a yummy breakfast. Fast service. Coffee is delicious. Bagel skinny sandwiches were good.,0
"Food was good, service was not as I expected, and felt very crowded due to the small area.",0
"Sushi and service here are always great, but the new sushi chef takes it over the top! Delicious rolls and really good yellowtail sashimi! I'll continue to be back here often!",0
"For being the inventor of the chimichanga it was VERY disappointing. The chimichanga was awful. Huge, but awful. It was soggy and bland. Service was bad despite being the only people in the restaurant.",0
"One word, Nicantoni's. See the original owner of Buono's.",0
"My favorite bar! Cheap drinks, country music and hip hop, and dancing the night away. Wednesdays are ridiculously fun for the younger crowd and early Friday and Saturdays are best for two stepping\n.",0
This is a family-run business.  The members of the family are charming people.  Stop in and try them out!,0
Place was okay. Hangover food that wasn't the tastiest. Not the cleanest place either but friendly service,0
"Eh. I know it's only fast food, but how many idiots are working in the kitchen? I wish there was a closer one so I could go there in the hopes that they'd get our order correct!",0
"Nothing matches in this place! The tables, the chairs, the tiles and that's how we like it! Lots of delicious vegan items. Definitely a good place to try new things. Good coffee too!",0
"If you love long lines and only 4 or less lanes open, then this is the place to be. The lines are long and the cashiers are usually old people who take their time with everything.",0
TERRIBLE!!! Would definitely not recommend. The gel polish came chipped 2 days after I got it!!,0
I've been here twice and both times did the prix fixe pasta tasting. The selections change frequently but it was always delicious and extremely satisfying.,0
I have been coming here since it opened. We ordered take out tonight and the quality was terrible. We were all very disappointed,0
good beer selection- both on tap and in the beer cave. located in a nice neighborhood.  the chili cheese dog is fantastic and so are the fries!!,0
Great fast food joint. Fresh taste filling size. It's hard to beat when you want something fast. I'm actually going to go back right now.,0
didn't think the pho tai was anything special.\nit was really oily.\nbetter than pho so 1.,0
I LOVE LOVE LOVE the chicken supremes! SOOO Good! I also love the sweet potato fries. My husbands favorite is the penne pasta dish with the sausage. It is really tasty.  Great place. I highly recommend!,0
"Great Food, Drinks and Service..  This is a place were you come casual and feel very relaxed.  I will be back on my next visit to AZ...",0
"Terrible Staff...Cashier chewed gum, talked on cell and asked that I excuse her behavior because it was close to closing.",0
This salon is very clean. I like how organized all the products for sale are. I made an appointment for a bang trim and Jason did my hair it looks terrific.,0
The only reason you should ever come here is for their pizzas after 11PM.,0
"Ok, I was going to write a review until I realized EVERYTHING has already been said.  Just go there at least once!  Especially if you like feeling dark and mysterious.",0
"I have been there twice, and they have my rear end differential and my brakes replaced. Also, they help me replace my passenger seat belt. Very good place.",0
"Best late night place to eat after a night of partying and whatevers.  Good food, nuff said.",0
"Before evening get to review the food:\n\nOne cashier, 10 people in line. You get the picture.",0
"Penguin is a cool spot. The fried pickles are good as sh?t, the burgers are good also. Good luck finding a seat though.",0

Had to large of a group they couldn't accommodate our large amount of people.,0

"I used to enjoy this for lunch on occasion - Sorry to say it CLOSED a couple months ago... I think \""Julio's Too\"" is still open.",0
"I finally found my dive bar.  Right when I walked into the Coach House I could smell the diviness. An old pinball game, cheesy darts, cheap drinks, and rockin music.\n\nI am in love.",0
Omg can food take any longer.. There is no one even in here.. Dam now i know why this place has 2 stars..,0
"I had the California tacos. The salsa was really good, but the tacos were sub-par. There are too many other good restaurants in the area to waste your time here.",0
"I had a delightfully salty sandwich. Although the wait was longer than acceptable---over half an hour---it was about worth it. I probably won't return unless gifted with free time, but it was a nice one shot.",0

The restaurant is beautiful and the service is just OK.  The food is nothing special and I don't see any reason to choose this restaurant again.,0
Love this place!! Not too pricey and so much food. Tacos are amazing and they make the guacamole in front of you.,0
Make sure you check the price I saw them charging more than the listed price and brought it to there attention to no avail,0
"Been here a few times... couple brunches & a couple dinners...nice place to relax & enjoy... prices aren't bad, the staff are nice & friendly...",0
"It's Wendy's.  It's a guilty, greasy, unhealthy pleasure.  That said, I love me a Wendy's milkshake.",0
"I was a little disappointed, the place is very old and the service was not great came in for dinner, way over priced for the portions and rice and naan not included! My suggestion is you read all reviews before going.",0
Lady was very very rude. Made insulting comments about my face.\nThe nails were done very fast and very sloppy. My mani pedi took 20 minutes. That is ridiculous. Never going back,0

"My family always has fun when we come here, pizza is ok, appetizers are better and desert is good! The entertainment is always fantastic, the downside...cash only",0
David (the bartender) was great! He served our party quickly and made sure our drinks were not empty. This will definitely be our go to place for late night food and drinks!,0
Great Lunch Spot! Seriously if your downtown and in the mood for a sandwich you should hit up sacks. They really have turned sandwich making into an art. There salads are delicious as well.,0
"Location, location, location. Without it this would be just another mediocre restaurant passing itself off for a great place to eat. In today's amazing world of eateries this joint needs serious reinvention.",0
The lamb kabob was cooked perfectly. Tabooleh and falafel were fantastic. Finished off with knafeh. Must try!,0
Let me tell you something; The service in this place is so bad I just walked out.  Enough said.,0
The pharmacy here is a joke... I have had several occasions of bad service here on top of one very rude pharmacist...Go across the street and save yourself the headache!,0
"Stopped by to exchange some items we received as a gift. The woman who attempted to help us was incredibly rude, unfriendly, and unprofessional and was completely not helpful. Thanks for nothing, Lana! Unbelievable!",0
Went there to grab lunch while on biz travel that was not too far from the airport. Menu was nothing special. Service was prompt. Food was good.,0
"Great and convenient!  Delivery was prompt and friendly! Mozzarella sticks were perfect even with the delivery, burger was delicious and so were the chicken wings. The best part of all, the brownie!!!",0
My husband come here every week.... the staff is friendly and always on point. Miranda and the other bartender girl are amazing. I would suggest you give them a try. I'm so in love with the 9oz  steak...,0
"My Father in sun lakes likes to eat  takeout  an average of once a week from here, we really enjoy the food",0
Best sports bar in town bar none.  Great food.  Golden Tee.  Dozens of TVs.  No reason to watch a game anywhere else.,0
"This is a great place to meet with friends before seeing a movie at the Art.    Great service and good food.   For a special treat, ask for the traditional menu, which features additional dishes (for the more adventurous).",0
"This is my favorite steakhouse! Their appetizers, salad are well made and delicious. The steaks are cooked to exactly to the diner's request. Great place to begin night on the town in uptown Charlotte or celebrate an important event.",0
"Service was good, attentive.  Pitcher of Marg, ok\nFood, Not very good\nDont think its all fresh Or all made on site",0
Great pizza and wings but some of the employees are rude.  Lot of good pizza in the area think I will start going elsewhere,0
They have the absolute WORSE customer service. So sad. No wonder I goto Nordstroms. Dillards even treated me nice. Time for Macy's to take notes...tisk tisk tisk.,0
this shop is closed.  don't bother the nice man that now has the number ;),0
I love this place!  It's a fun place to sit and relax and sip a glass of vino.  Be sure to order the bruschetta...I especially love the figs and prosciutto.,0
McGurkees is an all-time favorite. My family has been frequenting this great sandwich shop for over 20 years! Love the subs! Love the staff!,0
"This place sucks. \n\nOver priced. Sub par quality food. But the subs have cute pot related names and there's posters on the wall, so let's deal with it.",0
This is a nice place to attend special events.  Home to the restaurants of two James Beard award winning chefs is a big plus as well!,0
Their chicken taste like pork? Awful music along with the food.,0
"These guys will get it done!!! pack it, ship it, shredd it, Personal service is redefined here no better placeto get it done...",0
This sonic wasn't too far from my mother's in chandler so I came here a few times for cold drinks to get me thru the heat.  Both their flavored lemonades and ice cream drinks were excellent!,0
"Palace Station can Fuck off!!  And because you guys suck so bad, i'm thinking i might just avoid the rest of the station casinos and the bummer is i like the oyster bar. i'll survive without it!",0
they are not that bad. their food portions are huge. too bad they dont accept debit/credit cards. they add more veggies to their siamin.,0
Very dissatisfied with this hospital. I would never take myself or my family here again. The hospital is old and very dirty! Rude staff.,0
I highly recommend Dr. Quackenbush and the staff. Everyone is caring and so good with kids!,0

Great food. The gumbo is excellent. The atmosphere is relaxed. Definitely going back.,0
"Not bad,  not great. Nice atmosphere with kind and professional staff. Food? Typical bar food, nothing spectacular at all. Great place for older folks.",0
Great tasting food all made  from scratch and you can literary taste the love and care that goes into each dish.,0
The wings here are fantastic and the cheese sticks are absurd in a very good way. Will definitely be back.,0
"Waited at the pool for 30 minutes before being served. Comfortable beds. Live band at night. I didn't pick this hoyel, randomly it was selected. It was OK for the price.",0
The Holidays are coming and in the 'British' section they are not selling Vegeta seasoning anymore.,0
local treasure. i'm in love with this place. 7 dollar lunch buffet (always a mistake unless you plan on sleeping the rest of your day) and byob. recommended!,0
"Every time we go here it gets worse and worse. Dirty, rude employees, and less and less flavor. All three of ours were white snow at the bottom. Worst location! Clean it up and treat people well!",0
My Fiance and I went out for my birthday and we were very pleased with our whole dining experience. The staff was excellent we received our food and drinks very quickly. The food was also excellent. I will definitely be returning :),0
It you're basic bar food.  Nothing more.,0
This is located in the local area mall.  Only had a few people in front of me in line and it was moving incredibily slow.  Overall food was good.  How could you go wrong with Orange Chicken?,0
"I have been coming here for 6 years now, and no other place has been able to usurp this bar's place in my mind. Great place to Become a regular. i do the Karaoke Thursday through Sunday.",0
Great Mexican food. Really yum as my husband says. There are almost none choices for vegetarian.,0
Great for groups for cheese and desserts not for dinner. I like to be served not to cook my own meal ep for over $100 bill,0
Very disappointing one person doesn't know what the other one is doing!  Very unorganized establishment. Ill never take my dog to this location again!,0
"My very favorite place to have breakfast in Madison for 20 years! We go there every weekend. The spinach crepe is my personal favorite, but just about anything on the menu is great.",0
Decent food.  Accommodating hosts- I am sensitive to spicy foods and they made me a special dish even though I was having the buffet.  Bathroom could be cleaner.,0
I had to stop here just to pee and would never go in there again way to smokey.,0
"Do not go here.   Misdirection, Misdiagnosis, Miscommunication.  Result: Our sweet dog died the next day.",0
"We came here on a gift card, thank god!  the food is terrible, as if they are trying to cut costs with cheap product.  Service is good, food is a mess.",0
Love this place!! This place is fast and easy to get food from. They are open late and early. Their pricing is super affordable and the food is delicious!!,0
Borderline sanitation. Delicious food. Collards. Mac 'n cheese. Meatloaf. Obama tea.,0
Came here for my wife's birthday one year - had great food and the live jazz is a great plus.,0
"Wow. Worst customer service ever encountered. Maybe it's policy, maybe it's laziness. Either way, Pizza Hut off the map for me.",0
"As far as a place to meet friends, hang out, and play pool or darts, it's great.  Haven't had food here.",0
They were too busy to take our take-out order! Too bad. But...I'm glad they're so busy they didn't miss us!,0
"Hell. \n\nWhere customer service goes to die. They give ZERO sh*ts. \n\nThe Worst, always and forever.",0
"Good food, service is lacking! I used to go to mike and Rhondas the place but it is on bell which is a little far. Service is way better there and for quality is same. Maybe I'll go back",0
"Really good food, lunch prices are really affordable. 5 bucks for an entree, fried rice and an egg role. I always get the beef brocolli",0
Score! I paid $10 for enough tickets to win a tiny piece of crap kaleidascope!,0
Nice corner market with a very friendly staff and their breakfast sandwiches are amazing,0
"Ask for tha Anitas special tacos. OMG can you say \""Street tacos\""!",0
"McDonald's should never disappoint, but this one certainly will as they are slow as heck and 9 times out of 10, your fries WILL be cold!",0
"This place has EXCELLENT food, with generous helpings!\nMaybe that's why in the AM it usually has a bit of a line.\nI've never been disappointed, and the prices are very reasonable.",0
"Walked over before a dbacks game. Loved the beer garden, nice draft selection and good tunes. It will likely become tradition before future games.",0
My friend picked up food here for us and her chicken was hardly cooked! Another friend had the same problem! I think this sums it up!,0
Nothing off the charts but not bad for a simple lunch or dinner or to meet up with some friends.,0
This is where I would eat on Saturdays when I working.  The service was satisfactory at best and food was always good.,0
Rooms are very clean and the views are great.  The location is right in the heart of Charlotte and convenient to everything - easy walking!!,0
If you have time to look you should be able to find something you like here at a great price.,0
"If you are into crooked haircuts and terrible customer service, this is your salon.",0
"Best variety of fruit / pit / exotic trees, with (hopefully) appropriate chill hours for our region.",0
"Pretty good. Nice chips, good burrito. Haven't found any Wonderful mexican in Madison so far, but this is not bad.",0
"Overpriced...\nArtificially red salad dressing on a boring salad is just terrible...\nHonestly, go anywhere else for pizza!",0
I've never gotten food poisoning here. I have gotten screwed up orders alot. It would be nice to deal with more Americans though. All in all it's an average Del Taco.,0
A relaxing stay in the dessert. The rooms are spacious and the price is fair.,0
"The Earl Schib of Brakes.  If your wallet needs to have the dollars rotated out of it, then go here!",0
"Lot of food, if volume is your criteria, this is the place.  Good food, no, sort of like I remember army food.  Cabbage roll was way too salty.  Rack of ribs too fatty.",0
"flies everywhere, place is dirty and food not cooked well.",0
One word sums up this place - yuck.,0
"Everyone I have encountered has been very nice, welcoming and helpful.\nI loved every minute.  The massages I got were AMAZING!!!!!!",0
This is the kind of independent country place we all need to get behind and support if we don't want the entire landscape consisting of the big chain restaurants.,0
"I'm not sure I even realized this was here before tonight.  Thank goodness it is!  From time to time you just gotta have some DQ.  The kids behind the counter were pleasant, respectful, and pour a hearty cup.",0
Airports are airports. Facility was nice with easy to access information. Restaurants and food stops- average price. Airports are always more expensive.,0
I love this place so much. Delicious and fun to be at.,0
The food here stinks! I will never go back again! Don't waste your time and money there are other restaurants with better quality food!,0
This is good clean fun.  The best part to my story was I was willing to lose all my chips just to get to the bathroom and I just kept doubling up on the tables.  Thanks!,0
The cap was delish. the barista who made my drink was a rude bitch. If I was an asshole I'd taker dollar back.,0
I've been going here for over 6 years and hate to get my eyebrows done anywhere else! Ask for Annie she does the best eyebrows in Charlotte!! Mani-pedis are always great as well and they just got new massage chairs!,0
"Good prices on produce. Cashier told me that my receipt was in my bag & it wasn't, & she didn't say thank you or anything when she finished with me. Quite rude I think!",0
"Moved to NC from CT. I wanted to try this place out hoping it was like a deli with fresh meat and bread. Subs tasted just like subway to me, except more expensive. Nothing like a northern deli shop.",0
Love those Irish nachos! Decent selection of beer and good food!,0
The food overly greasy and unappealing and it all just felt extremely cheap and low-end.\nFood is bad a year than a year\uff0cI never come back\uff01,0
Dr. Adkins is the best vet. You can tell he loves his job and he makes you feel like he loves your pet too. He is thorough and knowledgeable. The office staff are very friendly and helpful.,0
"Amazing pastries! Gotta go and check it out.  We had the almond tort, cream horn and the gob. All great! Reasonable prices too.",0
I usually drive through for food.  Friendly and quick service.,0
"This school seems to overly teach to the test leaving overall student learning an afterthought.  Maybe this is just the way schools are now a days, but without a developed sports and arts program there are simply better options nearby.",0
A 2 hour 40 minute wait with over 1 hour between seeing the waitress.   Food reasonable but EXTREMELY LONG WAIT WITH NO EXPLANATION!!!!!! Service and food not worth the wait. Won't be returning.,0
We went in for some breakfast after a late night. Waited for ten minutes for anyone to talk to us. Walked around the corner to find the waitress asleep. Take a nap before you come to work!,0
"Two words: baby octopus.  Oh yeah, the honey toast is pretty good too.  :)",0
"Expensive, but always has the printer cartridges I need in stock, so really can't complain.",0
DJ Tsunami.... Mixes music like a train wreck. The beats are off he either ends a song then starts up another or he completely destroys the mix. I don't know where they got him but he needs to go back.,0
The only reason we went here was to use a gift card.... Just as disgusting as i remember.,0
"It was okay. I actually didn't like the food at all and thought it could have been much better. To their credit, I've been told they're known for their food so I will try it again with different results hopefully!",0
My wife said let's try this new place I was hesitant to try Italian drive-through food.But I must say it was way better than the Olive Garden!,0
They stop selling the soups early I wish they didn't!  Iam sick with the flu wanted a soup so my bf ordered fries it was ovrr cooked n tasted like chemicals.,0
"Beer still warm and service slow. Food was not hot. You would think they would want to have the coldest beer but as usual, they don't seem to care. Place is always empty and the reputation is going down",0
Great bread bowls. The wraps were awesome too. This is the only place in the valley that I know of that sells bread bowls.,0
Don't know about the nightlife scene here (anymore) but you really can't beat their happy hour. Its the good 'ol 2-for-1 cocktails and free food until 7pm! Can't beat that.,0
"Room was very small, smelled dirty, bath tub drained extremely slow. I will never stay here again. Light fixtures were rusting and room is outdated. Don't expect any type of luxury here. You get what you pay for.",0
I just didn't feel welcome. It was a small place and that's no problem but I just was never comfortable here.,0
Mmmm sweet Osaka. They have some of the best sushi you can get in Las Vegas.\nAs noted by another user the entrance looks like a crack house. They have traditional Japanese seating where you kneel and take your shoes off.,0
"This is a great place to get your dog's groomed if you can get them in, the wait for an appointment is ridiculous. It's almost worth the extra price to get them in sooner. :(",0
This barber shop is awesome my son is 8 years old and always looks great.  Manny is usually the one that cuts his hair but we have tried the others and there just as good. Very clean place.,0
Great old world service! Use Priceline to book your room. Become an Omni rewards member before you arrive to avoid the wifi fee ($10/night). Food and the room service rocks!,0
Nice & fresh but nothing spectacular. I'm still in love with Krispy Kremes.\n\nBring Cash!,0
Foam cups is about the only thing good about this place.  Food is below average.  I will not go back.,0
Every thing is over priced compared to many other stores that sell the same things,0
"Service was best part of our meal experience. Pork tenderloin was over cooked, mixed veggies were flavorless, trout was dry and overcooked as was the salmon. Very disappointed as I know they can do better.",0
"Food was disappointing. Hash browns were pre-formed, like the kind you get from McDonalds. I don't understand how this place has such high marks. Maybe it's gone downhill recently. I don't recommend.",0
"I liked this place. Got the pumpkin curry with shrimp. Not sure the shrimp are worth the price but I thought the food was good and the service was good. Not sure if I'll return, but would recommend it...worth a try!",0
Still love their bagels and apparently I am not the only one since they won Phoenix New Times for Best Bagel (2011).,0
"Ugh... Way overpriced, same taste as the food court at the mall. And when I asked to change one thing on a dish, was told \""NO\""",0
It all depends on the chef who is performing for you. I have been here twice in last several months and felt everything was average. I have seen other chefs in different restaurants and they have put on a much better show.,0
Sorry to break to you but  it seems another Village  inn has bitten the dust...,0
"The worst. They tried to have my car towed for parking in their \""delivery spot\"" that was marked with a sign so small you'd need binoculars to see it. Not cool.",0
order a claypot from the menu it come out different they substitute my chicken to pork spare ribs without telling me,0
"Okay, I came back and ordered the Beef Noodle Soup, and again I was disappointed.  The beef noodle soup was not tasty.  I will not be returning again.",0
Ten 10 Stars!!! LOVE IT!\nHow Much I Miss It!:(\nIf Your In the Tempe Area You Must Go!!! Great Delicious & Healthy Food!;) \nCan Wait To Go Back!...,0
"I love this area, it's a hidden gem...!",0
I'm amending my review and giving this place an extra star. This is going to be my regular nail place :),0
"Food was great. Drink was questionable. Service was truly sad. I'll try it again, because I've got a $25 certificate, and the food really was that good. I'll report again after that.",0
"I love these cakes - great flavor, moist, sweet frosting, over all delicious.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  However I only gave 4 stars because the store is closed on Sunday, the day I usually crave their cake!",0
Very diner like. Extensive menu and definitely something for everyone. Great service.  Good restaurant choice for the area for sure! Any place that roasts their own turkey and serves fresh mashed potatoes and gravy rates in my book.,0
"The food and service was okay. Nothing less, nothing more.",0
I would study here late night because they offer the endless coffee pot where they will refill your coffee all night! I've also eaten breakfast here with my parents before a football game!,0
"Stayed there for a few days and service was all right. There were no problems. The custodial staff was very great when we had a toilet situation. Overall, I was satisfied.",0
Meh. Not that great. I got the sesame chicken lunch combo and totally regret it. The egg roll tasted like it was previously frozen & lacked flavor. The chicken was way too salty and the rice was edible but nothing special.,0
CLOSED DOWN\n\nI just love circling around a shopping on a Friday night looking for a place that no longer exists...... not!,0
Doc was great! Very friendly and super informative. I have been to a few doctors in town and he was by far the best.,0
Terrible customer service. Especially Irene? I won't waste my time going back again.,0
If you like eight legged critters crawling around on our plate then you will love this place!  Three people came out and acknowledged this and still charged me full price!  Hope this this helps the future yelpers.,0
Do not come here it is a fake Sam Woo. I would give it 0 stars if I could. Rude service and the food is nasty.,0
Cute museum. Really hot in the desert. Cool history lesson of how the Hohokam Indians lived back in the day.,0
"Outside of the patio, not much to attract me to this place.  It is way too pricey for food that isn't any different or any better than any other Mexican place.",0
"Had an awesome lunch. Waiter had no personality, hard to hear and zero energy. The shave ribeye & cheddar was amazing.",0
Gorgonzola Filet was phenomenal & my Dad enjoyed his turkey dinner last night! Terry was our server and he was great! Definitely asking for him next time we go!!,0
It's very unpleasant to get home without your entire order!  The staff is in need of supervision and training.  It felt like you were in a field trip with a bunch of 5 year Olds running the restaurant!!!,0
"Very cool old place in the industrial part of town.  I wish it wasn't surrounded by two strip clubs (made for interesting conversation with young kids) but the food was pretty good, not greasy at all.",0
"Old fashioned kind of place.  Which means, reasonable prices, good service, tasty food in good quantities.  I've only eaten breakfast here many times, and then was only hungry for a late light dinner.",0
"They told me they could fix my car, but when they were done, they found more wrong with it.  A fifth grader could have done better.",0
"This is for a certain type of crowd: college, too broke, and too high to care.",0
It's okay. But better gyros are down the street at Z's Greek.,0
"the worst pizza ever. pizza dough isnt supposed to taste like Wonder bread, all doughy & sweet.  This place is an insult to Italian pizza.  These people arent even Italian. Just SAD.",0
Had the pasta special last night at Mama's and it was unreal.  Pure breast meat chicken bolognese in a tomato sauce with perfectly cooked rigatoni. Chef Drew hits another home run.,0
"Just had to give our drive thru order 3 times to the same person! Yes, 3 times. Contacts if you want my receipt number. I'll drive to one farther for basic competence.",0
"Rude people work for this airline and the planes are old and seats really tight. One of the worst in the US. In line with other awful airlines like united or American. If u can, fly virgin",0
"Another loyal customer lost!  Unless you want to throw your money away on over priced unnecessary \""recommended\"" repairs RUN AWAY!  Charged me nearly $100 more than GoodYear quoted.",0
This place is very affordable but the food is nothing special. It's relaxed place and is kid friendly. Cash only!!!,0
"Great lunch spot, really yummy sandwich and very shareable.",0
"Loved the exhibits and the tour. The Katsina exhibits were awesome. But, the museum shop is just not affordable - was disappointed to see I couldn't get any souvenir.",0
I used to really like this place but it seems the quality has dropped off. I picked up a to go order today and it reminded me why I had not eaten their food in almost a year.,0
Service was good waitresses friendly I ordered the burnt ends and they were fairly awful. I went because it was close to my motel. I will drive farther for food next time. Beware.,0
"This was a nice experience - the ambience nice, with the brick walls. The food very homemade tasting.",0
Not a bad place to get a giant burger.,0
Thursday night. Cheap drinks. Ok music. Just go.,0
"Your local Terrible Herbst.  It was clean and well maintained.  It had all that you would expect from a convienence store, it was convienent (hopefully I spelled convienent correctly, haha).",0
"Reminds me of a place back in Chicago me and my wife would eat at. Looking forward to the happy hour there, as the deals looked pretty good, and the food was excellent. Really liked it.",0
Update: the owner did write to me saying they will work on getting their takeout orders correct. I appreciate a business willing to improve.,0
"This restaurant is okay. The food is good, but not fabulous. And it's very expensive for only a so-so dining experience. I went there once, that was enough.",0
"had a terrible haircut and will never go to anyone else.\nstay with cynthia, she knows how to cut hair and she listen to what you want.",0
Nondescript place serving great bean & cheese burritos and tacos.,0
I'm really disappointed. The experience was really bad. The food was under-seasoned. I prefer Olive Garden over Carrabba for sure. \nI don't think I will come back to this chain.,0
"Mmmm, so dericious! they are always so nice, quick & our dinner is always fast. Happy hour is amazing & affordable!",0
"The staff is friendly and attentive. Too bad the food is so limited and not too impressive. There's some good items, but there's better places not to far for the same price point.",0
"Spectacular dinner!  Recently updated menu.  House made breads.  Incredible wine selection.  Reservations not required, but not a bad idea.",0
Worst sushi I've ever had- piles of rice and imitation crab meat is all I can recall.,0
Nice neighborhood wine bar.  Big pours.  Not much in the way of food.,0
"Not bad for a Hotel Bar.  Plenty of beer options but the food should only be eaten in a pinch.  Typical bar food burgers, nachos and chicken fingers, just pricey for the Quality.",0
"Love the midwest best sammie on garlic bread. I wish they had more drink options, but other than that I love the taste.",0
Dive right in! It's my favorite dive in Urbana but since Gremer is gone it's not quite the same. Had to move westward to the other side of the tracks to see my favorite bartender.,0
This place sucks. Food has gone downhill majorly. Fun for drinking. Bad for food,0
"All good, they don't make dumplins like me though!,",0
"Different kind of mexican food with a great atmotsphere, especially on the patio Service is always a little less tha excellent when busy. But overall our favorite maexican",0
"We stayed 3 nights and the place was empty for the most part.  It's starting to look a bit tattered, unkept.",0
The food is good. Your best meal will be breakfast. Be prepared to spend a few extra dollars.,0
A very good place to go for dimsum.,0
The place is clean the beer is very cold and the staff friendly!   A great place to grab a beer before you go to the movies next door!,0
"Love this store! Some of the cutest clothes, friendliest staff and best sales in town.  Only wish there was one in my home town of LA.",0
Great food great wine I would recommend we had kids went early everything was splendid,0
"The fish was good. But not better than other places in Vegas that have much better service and atmosphere. I'm giving this a 3 because that's what it is--pretty mediocre. It was good, but not a notable sushi place.",0
"They have the Amarone wine I sooo love. Wish the store was the size of the one in Atlanta, and this one has most of what I like. so will be going back",0
There was a 40 minute line for a car... And so many people waiting. I would anywhere rather than wait that long... Not recommended,0
"Art, the store manager, is completely incompetent.  The rest of the staff is pretty much clueless.  They lack a basic understanding of pool chemistry as well as customer service skills.",0
"Good bar. Love the micro brews! Nice and clean, fair prices, and nice staff. Haven't tried the food yet, but I hear it's good.",0
"umm..yea, all I will say is not-so-great.  For what it is, its expensive and the owner is a jerk.",0
"Fabric is priced cheap but you have to inspect it for imperfections/stains. I get frustrated with how messy the store is. Also don't like that there is no restrooms, I have to take my kid cross the street.",0
"Overpriced. The atmosphere is great, but the food is too buttery and overpriced. I went there twice last year. I forget exactly what I ordered, but I definitely remember the food being greasy and overpriced.",0
"Delicious!! Had chicken, waffles, mac n cheese, greens, and cornbread. I'm stuffed. Excellent friendly service!!",0
very avg lik most other indian restaurant!! though its decent compared to the price (9 bucks buffet)!!,0
"Food was ok, nothing great. Food network would say it needs salt. Worst thing was that they are cash only. Who does that anymore? Even the old lady behind me was digging for quarters.",0
Not the place you keep going back again and again.  Pizza sauce too sweet.,0
I just went in today to get a haircut. The lady that took care of me did a wonderful job and I would recommend anybody to go in there,0
Nick our server was very kind to us! Great service! Fun funny guy! Engaged my entire family! The girls that brought our food out was awesome as well!,0
this review is for their coffee shop.  One of the best kitchens in town.  Always a great meal.,0
"dinner was fantastic...all four of us were extremely happy with the food, service was get. Overall this place is a great local restaurant",0
close and quiet.  My kids go for birthdays and always have fun!,0
"The only salon after 15 years in Ahwatukee that has given me a nail infection. For instance, if you get gel nails, they put your hands right on the dirty UV machines, with no towel.",0
"Decent pizza, but not great.  Garlic cheese bread was mediocre.  Apple pastry dessert was pretty damn good.  I give the experience 3.5 stars.",0
"Good burgers. Great place for a good old fashion hamburger, fries and a beer.",0
"Alex is the nicest chef in town! The food is great value and the atmosphere is best. One hint: go on a cold night, the dining area is always very warm.",0
"Our favorite sushi restaurant in Charlotte, by far.  You can waste your money at all of the chi-chi, trendy joints in town - or you can go to kabuto, where the sushi is delicious (and cheap!)",0
"Very friendly staff and clientele.  Prices are reasonable, even lower than what I found elsewhere on the strip.",0
Terrible service. Very rude food server. Embarrassed to have brought my family there. Will never go back.,0
"Yummy and great!   Awesome rolls.   The Salmon Bomber is probably one of the best rolls I have ever had, at any sushi joint, but watch out, it's spicy!",0
They sometimes have some really good deals on shoes. It can be hit or miss but worth checking out over a foot locker.,0
OMG!!!! Best place EVER!!! I go there every year for my birthday. I love how many they options that they have. Also the dessert is AMAZING!!!!!,0
"Can't say I've ever had a great experience here, but they have a good selection and fair pricing so I put up with their crappy service and the occasional returned item.",0
Another store which has gone the way of the Dodo bird. Actually there was nothing basement like about it. What will be done with the empty space that is the question?,0
Did not make me want to go to Indonesia.\nSorry this is so brief but there was nothing extraordinary about any part of our meal.\nService was so so.\nProbably will not return.\nVery pricey.,0
Great dinner specials (choice of three different dinners for $6 when I went). You get a lot for your value. Food wasn't too bad either. Worth checking out if you live nearby.,0
LOVE this place!  GREAT service everytime!,0
"I walked in to try the fish sandwich that I have heard so much about but decided not to stay. The smell of smoke is over powering.  If your not a chain smoker, opt for takeout.",0
"Brunch was delicious!  I enjoyed the scrambler - all components were cooked perfectly.  Loved the beer bread.  Others in the party recommended the omelets as well.  Generous portions, reasonably priced and fun atmosphere.",0
Expensive for some lousy NY-style pizza. Cost $35 for 2 larges! The pizza itself was greasy and fairly untasty. Better off with Barro's or hungry howie's.,0
The staff sucks beyond rude. Shouldn't be in business. Don't know how to make drinks. Don't waste your time or money going to this place. The nut job lady in the morning needs to be on meds.,0
"Some of the worst  food I have ever had, I would think twice before I ate here again even if I were close to starvation. Stay away!",0
"Yuck. If you want an extra large dose of salt, sugar, and a variety of chemicals in your food, by all means eat here. Not to mention it's way overpriced for the garbage they serve. Enjoy!",0
So I went here bcuz my car was running hot they were nice.checkd it out and had me on my way n lil over an hr,0
"This is the holy shrine for reloaders.  I came here from the People's Socialist Republic of California and was treated very well by the staff, who were both knowledgeable and pleasant.",0
Drinks are good but food sucks. I tried the food multiple times and I think only the french onion soup and salads are descent. The main courses are very low quality.,0
"First time in today and it was a great experience.   My barber,  Neil,  did a fantastic job and was a great conversationalist,  as well.  Definitely coming in next time I'm in Las Vegas!",0
"Great sales/finance staff! Smooth, easy car buying process. Horrible service department! Communication along with their customer service is terrible. Will not buy from again because of service department.",0

Lisa and Sam in the service department were GREAT!!!  They helped us out that words can't even describe.  Thank you SO much!!!!,0
I just don't get this place's success.  Bland food in a bland atmosphere.,0
The food was good enough. The service was so slow I got irritated. I felt ignored by the hostess and waitress I will not be going back.,0
"Way way over priced, minimal selection and not too friendly. A friend Recommended this place and he was unaware of how much he was paying and didn't have too! Not impressed to say the least!",0
Great food!! They have been in biz for 45 years,0
Slow service\nBelow average food \nIll pass,0
"This is the best place to get your car washed! They care... Although no free vacuums, they dry your vehicle for no water spots. They're equipment is top notch.",0
Best insurance group to be part of!!! great rates for my entire family and I even saved money on my home insurance. I highly recommend it to everyone.,0
Only had a couple things at this attractive little restaurant - a soup and spring rolls - but I have definitely had better!  The service could be a little more relaxed.  I think I'll stick with Thai House.,0
Awesome place if you like your hair looking like you are 8 years old. Disappointing.,0
"Worst! Service is good, \""food scraps\"" are too expensive and tasteless.  They also use a bait and switch method in their pricing.  Spend your $100 elsewhere!",0
"Good pizza  & good service, I do the delivery thing here and so far, so good.",0
We went and the service was slow and our food was wrong.  I won't go back.,0

"Always tasty takeout, and they make my chicken and broccoli to order.",0
"The atmosphere is like any other chain sports bar, service was bad, and I don't think I will be returning. Nothing stood out about this place with so many other great options just a block away.",0
"Old school breakfast. $4.95 - two eggs, livermush and heaping hash browns!   24 hr!  What's not to love?",0
The prices are obscene they cook in nasty old grease we had the fish and shrimp both were awful and not enough a two year old could prepare better food! We were Very disappointed and will not be going back.,0
"This place is a sweet dive. I've never been here on a busy night, but I do know that its a good place to enjoy cheap drinks  and edible bar food after work.",0
This place is amazing from top to bottom. 2 hours down we are still here.,0

"Quick to be seated.  Good service.   Best food that I've had on this trip, but not so amazing that I have to come back.",0

"Great Lube! Awesome manager, he pointed out something that was wrong with my car!! Very thorough and considerate.",0
"Food wasn't that good for an expensive steak house, a step above Outback. Supposedly our waiter had been there for 40 years, he sucked!!!!! Service was terrible",0
"Nice place. Pricy for being in a mall, and the waitress never let us know about any specials.",0
"Like a poor mans version of Sweet Tomatoes. Less choices and less flavor. It's pretty disappointing. Spend the extra couple bucks and drive down the street to a better salad bar, or go to a real restaurant",0
We just had the ice cream and it was great - recommended for a treat.  I think there are about 10 flavors on the menu and lots of toppings.,0
Very Beautiful restaurant - that's about it.\nI didn't expect fine dining but this was tasted like overpriced tv dinners.  It used to be ok now it just falls way short of acceptable.,0
We just tried to eat at takara. I say try because we walked out after waiting 80 minutes for our food. Horrible service.,0
$20 for a Fossil watch battery and I had to come back 15-min later. While waiting I noticed several kiosks offering watch battery replacement from $10.,0
Food is always good. Service is a little slow but they are super friendly. Thai hot is actually hot! Better then the thai restaurants down town for sure,0
"We like this place. A tad on the pricey side. but portions are large. Staff is always friendly and the place isn't so loud that you can't hear the people you are with. Pleasant atmosphere, clean and cozy.",0
My breakfast was disgusting last time. Waits have been so long! Waiter was dull. My eggs were half cooked. Way over priced.,0
"Been twice now, owner and counter service very friendly.  The food is ok when you have a need for Chinese American food fix.  Deep fried items are REALLY deep fried... small-ish crunchy bits of chicken kind of thing.",0
"Sad to say, our beloved trainer is leaving this location. She'll be managing their new facility at 91st and T-Bird. Good luck, Maya!",0
Great place for breakfast. Definitely a go to place.,0
the guy has issues.\n\nI think unless your're a good looking girl won't even help you. \n\nDon't waste your time,0
"Steak was good service was not good, and very slow. Beautiful scenery but overall over all over priced,,, would not recommend.",0
"Fast, friendly, but flavorless. Beef and broccoli was tender but had the flavor of water",0
this place was great. but they are now closed.,0
Our pizza was totally raw!  Completely disgusting and totally un-edible.  I would give 0 stars if I could.,0
"They were SO rude....Dr. Romine was nice enough to stop by and said \""anything you need make sure you contact us\"" but besides that they were just plain rude. Definitely not going back....",0
"This place is so horrible, with the Air conditioning being so hot out side they must keep it at 80 degrees, The restrooms are GROSS and uncleaned...",0
All the people here are super nice. I really enjoy to have meal here. The price is  also really reasonable. Every dollar you spent here worth more then it.\nI would like to go there with my friends next time.,0
Brunch here will get your day off to a nice start. \nIts also a nice place for a date. don't remember what i ate but I remember enjoying it.,0
"19 beers in tap, specialty bombers and great pizza.  Also, they have live music and sports.",0
My first impression was that this quaint restaurant is certainly not a chain.  My last impression was how do I get out of here never to return!,0
"Best airport wifi of any airport I've been to! It's hardly crowded, but the taxi lines can get ridiculous -- they move fairly quickly, though.",0
I don't understand what is so great about this place. I got the tacos and it was one of the worst that I ever had. I just moved here and still searching for a great taco place.,0
Me & some friends came here for lunch but an hour pass by & we never received our food... we end up leaving because our lunch time was over... never coming back to this restaurant,0
Cheap Taco's and food. The walls are polka dots. The food isn't half bad for what you pay Service isn't stellar normally I'm reminding them what comes with the meal and to make sure I get what I ordered.,0
"Don't drink the water... or eat the food. I got serious, serious food poisoning from this place.",0
Yea I come here often but don't ask for help they make you feel bad for asking like you are stopping them from heart surgery.,0

"Not the best, not quite the worst.  Pretty cool staff however.",0
Do no stay here if you plan to sleep before 2:30 AM. They could not care less that there is a very loud bar directly across the street. If loudness doesn't bother you than this place is fine.,0
Food was ok. I was expecting more from this place. I dont really get the hype.,0
Great Customer Service - Nice Collection Bringing California to ASU\n\nThey help me purchase presents for my daughter,0

Food was not so good. Staff did not look healthy; Whataburger needs to pay their PHX employees more money.,0
Morgan was great best breakfast in cave creek. Harolds is a lot of fun at night and always a good time,0
Had a good little breakfast for under $6.00. Simple decor friendly staff.,0

"this place is super fire, I like this pizza better than the one next door which is also great.  its a must try.",0
"High production values, great plays, wonderful acting, PICT offers a lot to theater fans in Pittsburgh.  They perform at the Stephen Foster Memorial Theater on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh.  The season series is a good value.",0

"If you're seeking bland, salty, Chinese food where every entree tastes exactly the same as the other...this is your place!",0
I like the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich here. I also like the selection of beers and flights. Real chill place to go and kick it with some buddies or to start off a night.,0

My waiter was awesome and my food was.delicious i.got.chicken fajita tacos. Mmmm love it,0

"Parking is always a jam, but the food and atmosphere rocks.",0
Small little place down to earth quiet setting awesome biscuits and gravy you have to come before 11 or you won't get breakfast,0
"Now this is a pizza place!!! Very good and very well priced. Wings aren't \""the best\"" out there, but they are the best wings I have tried at a pizza joint. Very good spot or pizza",0
Beautiful by day and night.  Luminaries and Chihuly are a must see!!  Makes for a very nice evening!,0
"the food was cold including the soup,fries.  the brisket was dry and the service was awful.  The ruben was awful.",0
"I ordered a half chicken and potatoes. I was surprised to have received a half of a gaming hen chicken. I was very good, but i was wanting more. Small portions.",0
"Took 45 minutes to rent a car with only 1 person in live ahead of us. They were too busy trying to upsell. Good for their business, bad for customers. Problems checking car back in on return. Will never rent again.",0
Gone!- Drummed out of business!!!,0
"The barley soup was the saltiest soup I have ever tasted.  Salads and hummus plate are severely overpriced.  If I ever come back, I'll stick to the burgers.",0
"Okay so Panda Express sucks more than this place, if that gives you any idea of the quality and taste.",0
Not a bad place. I came to the jazz and poetry night Tuesday. I enjoyed the atmosphere and my cheap beer. The round booths facing the stage makes for comfortable place to sit for a few hours.,0
Not impressed by this place at all. The bartenders were not friendly at all and the place looked like a dump. Not suprised since it was off Grand.,0
Not good. Don't think I'll be coming back here. Food is overpriced for the quality. The beef is slimy. And the wait staff doesn't pay attention.,0
The place is very small and not very busy but the service is great. Filled my wine glass to the TOP!,0
Still love the food for what it is. Service is friendly but it's been a consistent long wait whether its inside or drive thru for over a month now. Please hire more night staff! This is frustrating!',0
"Good vegan split pea soup, prices a bit high for what you receive though.",0
As always the food was perfect and service was great!  We are a large family with 3 little ones and Anita's and staff always go out of their way to accommodate us.,0
Every time I've been here I always see multiple health code violations. The French fries are pretty good but the Reuben made me very ill.,0
"It's September 26, 2014 and still no resolution. Glad that my fingers still work and that I can do their work myself. DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS COMPANY!",0
Fun place to get wet in the summer heat. This park has a large wave pool but not a lot of slides. Found the slides just OK. Think they are over due for something new.,0
"Terrible pizza, tasted like it was from a box. Bread tasted like it was from a bag.\nGave it a try twice, will not come back.",0
So big and filling. A great place for a great burger.,0
"Dale Brown is honest, affordable and knowledgable.  I trust that he will take care of my car at a fair price.",0
