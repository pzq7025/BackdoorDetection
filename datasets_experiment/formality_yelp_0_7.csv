Very clean theater with a very friendly staff. Average age of the customers is about 85 yo so try to avoid afternoon showings and go later at night when it's less crowded.,0
"Too bad the food was amazing, because the kitchen focused on getting 1 party's food out, 6 other tables had to wait for their food more than 45 minutes.",0
Michael Jackson makes for surprisingly good music to eat their food to.,0
This place is everything a diner should be!  The food is good.  The service is prompt and friendly.  The prices are quite reasonable.  The portions will not leave you hungry.  I am looking forward to my next visit!,0
"Tried the Atkins plate, corned beef, cottage cheese.  The beef was good. Fine Deli cottage cheese. A bit expensive.",0
Local slot casino. No table games. But the main attraction is Fat Choy!,0
"The sushi was fresh, the service was great, it felt like a genuine restaurant from Japan. Whenever I went, there was always a bit of a wait, but the wait is worth it.",0
"I thought that the food was very greasy and heavy...\n\nThe service was a tad slow, but thats okay with me...",0
"Nice shop. Will work with you on price if you ask but it's limited depending on the bike you want. Overall HD presentation won't compare to AZ HD or Hacienda, but that lower overhead may save you money.",0
Great happy hour specials. Tasty sushi. And Chelsea (bartender) was VERY pleasant and accommodating. :-),0
Every thing is over priced compared to many other stores that sell the same things,0
"I was a little skeptical to go here because of reviews. I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered Mongolian beef, curry chicken and Szechuan green beans. It was all really good and reasonably priced!!  Loved the green beans!!",0
"overpriced, ceviche was decent, guacamole was good- also had chicken quesadillas which literally tasted like they had chicken in them from McDonald's (so gross!!!!)",0

They don't allow for online ordering and did not pick up the phone when I called in the order. Either they are shut down or they are the worst Domino's Pizza I have ever encountered.,0
i love pho so 1 but they gotta keep the place clean..seriously,0

"It's pretty good, just a little crowded.",0

"What a great Practice!   Doctor Lokey's is an extremely knowledgable doctor and she has such a warmth to her, that it makes it easy for anyone to openly communicate with her.",0
"This place is great! The burgers are amazing and the coleslaw is fantastic. 4 stars because it's pretty pricey, but worth it for a fabulous meal.",0
By far THE best cucumber martini around. Very light & fresh. The only thing that would make it better is if they would put a thin slice of cucumber on top instead of a wedge of lime.,0
Fun friendly place. The food is ok & better than other Mexican places in the same area.,0
"Never, ever trust TGI to install  your carpet or provide a rebate in the promised time. EVER. Especially if you are promised a rebate.",0

Hated it! Tried the Cuban sandwich and the pork was very dry.,0
"Had the Bayou burger, it was awesome!",0

Had a really great blueberry bagel with strawberry cream cheese!  Saw the reviews and was a little nervous but mine was perfect!,0
"Italian owned, so you'd think they could make some authentic dishes. Not impressed.",0
hands down best bagels (in the world?),0
The most arrogant and pretentious staff of any Home Depot I have ever encountered. It is well worth going to Route by magnitudes of infinity.,0
This place is awesome! My favorite lesbian bar in town!,0

This place was ON IT! The staff was very friendly and did anything they could to make our visit better!,0
"Great selection, and VERY helpful staff.  Highly recommend!",0
The food quality and selection were not good.  The desserts looked as if they had been prepared by Wal-Mart.  I will not be going back for seconds.,0

"Unfortunately quality suffered the past 2 years, but still a good place to grab a quick lunch while in the area.",0
BBQ joint pretty good. Lots of options.,0
The chicken fajitas are marvelous. The tortillas are handmade and the chicken is moist and flavorable. Our waiter on this recent visit was efficient  and friendly. Our only complaint was the carnitas were loaded with fat.,0
"Got an amazing assortment of pastries from here to serve at my royal wedding watching party on Friday. It was fun to eat such delicate and gorgeous creations - and they tasted delicious, too!",0

great restaurants and fabulous people.  Have to love the Southern Hospitality even from the TSA agents,0
They cropped my negatives and printed way too light. Really disappointed. Need to find somewhere I can do it myself.,0
Worst airport for baggage claim. They move carousels all the time and take forever to deliver the bags. Should be so much easier than what they make it.,0
If you don't know about Dillard's then I'm not telling you!,0
"This was a good restaurant but the menu has been downgraded to Bar Food, too bad as this was our go-to place when out on the lake.",0
I've never had a problem buying iPhones from this store until today. I went in to buy 3 iPhones and walked out with none. That should say enough about this store.,0
Typical BofA but at least there is never a huge crowd here.,0
Service was ok... My pasta was over cooked.,0
"Food was DELICIOUS, the service was a little crazy but if you can get past that its pretty worth it.",0
"I like this Starbucks!  Very quick, good baristas, and plenty of seating - inside and out!",0
"Best Mexican food around. If you like spicy, the Bomberro Burrito is a must. Bomberro sauce has a smokey, sweet flavor with an intense burn sensation. It compliments the meat and tortilla extraordinarily well.",0
The sushi is pretty good and the staff is friendly. I'd definitely go back and recommend this place to a friend.,0
I'd be a little cautious about eating at a restaurant with a C rating from the health department...,0
"We love this place! Food is good, bartenders are very friendly. Best happy hour prices in town!",0

"Good chicken salad, but wheat bread was ordinary.  Other sandwiches looked decent as well.",0
"Okay, I love this store.  You have to visit If you're looking for an ultra cool rug (simple geometric patterns) or end-table... Anything related to the home- but especially those.  Prices are phenomenal.",0
The pizza we had was very greasy. server was nice but I'm rating it on the food and I just can't do more than 2 stars because it was too greasy.,0
Chicken Katsu was horrible. Over cooked & massive fatty chicken yuck.,0
"Nice airport and the Southwest experience was great and affordable as usual,",0
This confirms my opinion that restaurants that claim to have a great view rarely have good food but are always overpriced.  This one is also old and run down.,0
"The QT's are pretty much standard across the valley...clean bathroom, stocked merchandised, minimal wait times, friendly staff.",0
"the hummus was a little on the oily side, but everything was great! i only wish that i could have tasted the tomato cram soup everyone raves about...my boyfriend ate it!",0

"the 4 stars are for the beautiful patio, excellent service, and great chips and salsa.  the food is good...not great, but overall a very nice dining experience every time.  o",0
Disappointing. I waited over 45 min for a $25 pizza that tasted like a frozen deep dish pizza you get from the grocery store.,0
Delicious! Not only are the deep dish pizzas great but the thin crust pizzas are also amazing.,0
"The French fries were so soggy you could use them as shoe laces, also portions were undersized not one of the containers were full to the top, not that any of us wanted to eat them",0
I decided to give this place another shot.  I ordered the Chef's Special and asked if they could substitute the meat with hash browns.  They said no substitutions.  So I got up and left.,0
not happy with this dealership because you cant reach anyone in service and it goes straight to the answering machine and then they never return your calls.,0
"Staff was real friendly, but the food was just ok.",0
Gotta love Chen Wok!  This place is FAR better than Kentucky Fried Panda (Panda Express)!,0

I still haven't eaten here. Its crazy I know but I sure enjoy the black velvets. Ill update this review when I've eaten here.,0
Tony was rude to me and his employees when I was there. If he was the only person I had dealt with it would have been 1 star. The woman that initially helped me brought it up a bit because she was very nice.,0
Been here many times and the food is good the prices are affordable and the service is outstanding the place is busy every time I go in so you know the food is good,0
It was so so.  I actually prefer Einstein Brothers Bagels.,0

Sooo good! Fantastic cheese! Great salsa. But the cheese...... SOOOOOOOO DELICIOUS!,0
Four Peaks is one of my favorite places to go in AZ. The food is unbeatable as far as bar food is concerned if you ask me. Try the French Dip with a side salad. The best ever!,0

always had positive experiences at this store. no complaints.,0

"Poor customer service, inferior work and overpriced.",0
"Not a fan, but I keep coming back due to old habits.... The previous coffee shop in this location was excellent. This one has mediocre coffee and a very slow internet connection. Not a good combo if you want non-grumpy customers.",0
USED to be great!!! I don't know what happened. Please bring the old Eastwind back!!!!,0
"Excellent food, great service,  reasonable prices.",0
There is a reason this restaurant has over 60 reviews. It might not look like the greatest neighborhood but Great food at an affordable price!\nThe place was quite clean and droned a nice ambiance as well!,0

2 for 1 Jameson shots for $6!!,0
Great restaurant style pasta. Delivered to your home or available at some local gluten free retailers. Nice option for a gluten free menu. Almost indistinguishable from wheat based pastas.,0
First time I have ever seen a roach crawl across the table as dinner was being eaten.,0
I was not very happy with the service or the milk tea I purchased this morning...I don't think I will be returning here again!!!,0
"It just isn't as good as it used to be. Even using a coupon, the quality of the beef and bun were just sub-par. I won't be wanting to go again for a long time, if ever.",0
"Seems like a good bar atmosphere if that's what you're after, but the pizza is just ok. The other food is pretty good, but portions are not satisfying at all.",0
"One of the best Koran restaurant in tempe for sure, love their tofu soup, especially winter also the BBQ pork is good too!",0
"If you're coming in here for a burrito, you're better off walking that extra block and getting one at Chipotle.",0
The staff is great but the beds...not so much.  The place could use an overhaul.,0
The pho is always tasty and full of whatever meat you decide to order. Servers aren't obnoxious and the prices are very fair. paying at the cashier rather than your table is a nice and convenient touch.,0

It's getting better as the new owners remodel and get in some new tenants.,0
"The salsa was ok, the food was ok. Te staff was nice and helpful. I might stop back in if I was in need of a Mexican fix but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here.",0

"I have been very disappointed in this KFC. The service is lousy, the employees do not have a good customer service standard. My orders are consistently wrong. After my last bad experience I wrote them an email and they didn't even respond.",0

The staff was very friendly.  Dr. Podloski is fantastic!  They help me get a new pair of sunglasses.  I thought the name brands they carry is much better than some of the other places in town.  Thanks!!,0
"Terrible doesn't even begin to describe Cox Communications. From customer service to billing, they will scam and extort the customer at every angle. Quite possibly the worst business I have ever dealt with.",0
Had to pay for a styrofoam cup just so I can get water because they ran out of plastic water cups.,0

Food is amazing!!! And staff is ALWAYS so nice!!!,0

"Steaks were really good, theres so much stuff too look at, and the views at night are spectacular!",0

I was disappointed in the pulled pork sandwich.  There was very little flavor and not enough sauce on it.,0
I do not understand how a plate of pasta and a glass of wine can turn into a $60 bill. Quality of the dish is more in line with a $5 plate fom a food court.,0

"Yep it's a Dairy Queen, It's a little busy around 7, but worth the wait.",0

"Very busy, some of the employees are rude and my hubby needed some asthma pills which they have a card you have to give the pharmacy and they lady was well not very smart.....",0

Not my favorite place in the world I love in and out they by far have the best burgers Lennies burgers is alright but if you really want a real good burger you go to burger bar in Vegas.,0

I couldn't love this store more! location is great and there is so many selections to choose from along with the massive amounts of fresh flowers brought in weekly,0

Fresh Raw Cow and Goats Milk.MMMm,0
This place is more about the scene than the sushi.  I just don't think that the sushi is anything to write home about.,0
This place does not have good italian sauce it tasted like chef boyardee and my crab cakes were not cooked in the middle it was cold. I wont be back.,0
"Came here to get an oil change and had no problems. They were friendly, fast, and the manager even gave me a discount. Will be back--",0
The airport is always very clean and a bonus with plenty of slot machines. The only negative thing is that the security check point is always long.,0
Wow.... I understand when you are in Vegas and your drunk food usually tastes better. but cmon MAN... food is terrible and well over priced!!!!  I will definitely not return to this place.,0
"The chicken teriyaki was very fatty and mostly dark meat. The sauce seemed to have a lot of cornstarch or other thickening agent. It's open late, has low prices, and has relatively fast service.",0
"Went to Harper's yesterday to eat, but as soon as I saw the B rating, we left.",0
"Good jukebox selection, but the tables here have seen better days.",0
Paid way to much for chicken with No Pasta. Giuseppe's  30yards away just as good if not better and they have a $10 menu,0
Don't ever change your Verizon wireless plan at this location they lie about the change then your stuck with their screw up... Also calling the Verizon costumer service does nothing they are just as useless as the rep in this store....,0
The food is not good.  The scene is difficult to enjoy if you have progressed beyond the frat party stage of your life.,0
PRICEY! thats all! :-) Staff is very friendly but holy shit are they expensive!,0
I got what I expected...a smog test for $9.99. It may not be a purrfect auto repair place but it's way cheaper than any other smog test in Las Vegas.,0
I like breakfast but not here.  It's just kinda nasty and the quality of their ingredients is pretty low.,0

Wonderful experience.  Awesome rooms and friendly staff.\n\nWill elaborate more later.,0
"Food is amazing - authentic French food! You can choose to dine inside, dine outside for some Kierland people watching, or they have a private patio lit with lights and candles for a more romantic setting.",0
"I really enjoy this place for a Sunday breakfast. We usually go for the omelettes, but enjoy the pancakes and the banana bread is to die for. We started splitting an omelette lately, because they are huge.",0
This used to be a great place to go but the quality of the food has really declined.  Sadly I won't be going back.,0
"I am not impressed with their food, Taco Bell is far better.",0
Good food but they upped the minimum for delivery to $20. I realize that they are a small company but get real! $20 is far too much to charge for delivery,0
This place used to be one of my favorite places to go. All the food is authentic chinese made cooked by chinese. The portions are more than generous with good prices. Visit this place you won't be disappointed..,0
"While I was eating, a coach roach ran across my table!  I immediately stopped eating and threw it in the trash and left disgusted.",0
"Without a doubt the coolest bar in vegas, the most awesome bartenders, the best machines ive played in vegas, and you can get the best pizza, wings, and sandwiches in vegas all in the same place. LOVE them",0

Our bartender didn't know what a pint was or how to pour a beer,0
"The dentist was very nice, but the dental hygienist was more concerned about her lunch than my teeth cleaning. I won't be going back.",0

The locals told me that this is one of the best places for good old fashioned Wisconsin ice cream here in Madison!\n\nI went and was scrumptiously delighted!!,0
The Peking fried rice and Mongolian beef are amazing. Definitely the best Chinese food on this side of town. Staff is friendly and helpful.,0
Asshole driver bilked me by charging $2. upon entry to McCarran Airport. The fee is only for leaving. What a cunt.,0
I had the pad thai and the California roll. Both were pretty good but not mind blowing. They do have a very robust menu so I would go back to try more of their offerings.,0
"First of all the portion of the food definitely does not equals to the price they charged, food was okay, don't expect the service is any better, you serve yourself, at the end there is a 15% mandatory tips.",0
"When people say, \""The Cheesecake Factory\"", what I hear is \""The Diarrhea Refinery\"".",0

The cheese curds are glorious!!! Reminds me of Midwest food and the service is good. Great place to watch football games and have a good time,0
"The Omelette House has been my business breakfast location for the past 20+ years. The food is excellent, the service is great, and the atmosphere makes it \""feel like home\""!",0
I love this place a lot. I always try and come here whenever I am in the area. The machaca is awesome and the tortillas are amazing.  I haven't found anything on the menu I didn't enjoy.,0
This place gets 3 stars for having so-so entrees and sushi that is pricier than more up-scale sushi restaurants downtown.,0

You'll be craving their hot & spicy cheese bread after your first taste... Sooo good!,0

"Besides the fact that this place has awesome interior design and an amazing and authentic menu, they have half liter Mexican Cokes. Nothing beats a Mexican Coke.",0

It's a home depot.  Nothing special but also nothing bad.  It's everything I expect from a HD.,0
This spicy chicken soup is a must have when sick. Always makes me feel better when my hubby brings it home for me.,0

The Convention Center needs better souvenir store/vendor. Everything looked old and used. Not a lot of souvenirs to pick. Poor souvenir  store. Need major improvement.,0

"Still a decent stop anywhere for the whole coffe shop thing, but have been enjoying some of the other coffee shops in the area a bit more.",0
Another reason that I love the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport is because I can always get through the security in record speed. I have never waited longer than 10 minutes and that is pretty amazing.,0

This place has some of the best pizza in the Pittsburgh area. I love the lunch specials.,0
Service was a little slow but great food and an interesting atmosphere.,0
Service is very slow for only 6 people in the entire restaurant! It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.,0
Nicole is the most unorganized dispatcher I've ever worked with. The cab was an hour late and the driver drove in circles to rack up a bigger ticket. Wouldn't recommend these guys to anyone.,0

The food was delocious and the service was great,0
I've lived at Dakota for several years and I'd say overall it's a beautiful community and the location is perfect.  Staff could be a little more pleasant.,0

Nothing beats a bean and cheese with both red and green salsa.,0

"While the staff is very polite and attentive, the food is mediocre and over priced.  I would not reccomend this to anyone for any occasion.",0

Really greasy but if that's what you're looking for it tastes quite good!!,0

Zach at Ganem Jewelers is fantastic!!!!,0
By far the worst pharmacists ever. Aren't they suppose to be helpful? Weird. Don't go here. They are the worst.,0
This is my favorite restaurant in Tempe. The food is great with many vegetarian options. The atmosphere is usually pretty quiet and the servers are all nice. Highly recommended,0
I love the place! the food is always good. I never have any problem going there. The only thing is that the place is little too big. Too many distance and space but like I say the food is good and the price is right,0

we ate lunch here yesterday and everyone left happy and full!!!! it was good!!1,0
"nice airport, very clean, lots to offer the traveler",0
ALERT\n\nThey changed their burgers in June 2012!\n\nReviews prior to that date are not the burger you will be served!,0
"Some of the best Thai food in town. Service is friendly, however; does not qualify for speedy. Worth the trip to Chinatown-great Tom Yum!",0
Best Gyros in Illinois. Fast and delicious. A campus treasure. A Champaign treasure.\n\nThe gyros are authentic and the santiki (?) sauce is second to none.  Greek salads are another highlight.,0

Marty was incredible to work with! He did a wonderful job with our pool fence- showed up on time and the fence is fabulous! We would recommend him to anyone!,0
If you want to wait in line for horrible overpriced food and bad service here is the place. Do not go here.,0
Maybe a step down from Mineos Pizza which is not that great either. I agree with yelpers who identify a sweet taste. How do Mineos and Aiello's have such good reputations? It is a mystery to me?,0
The sushi isn't my favorite and their edamame is very bland. The service is friendly and I love the environment. Interesting decor such as a big fish tank and cool lamps,0

Beware of any warranty. They will change the rules and not honor a lifetime warranty.\nVery poor business practice.,0
"Not the best sushi in the world but I appreciate the value of their lunch specials as well as the charm, panache and mystique of the bartenders. \n\nTip - They also make a fantastic squid salad.",0
"The security guard who works at the front desk is rude, unfriendly and offensive as can be.  He seems to think he owns the place and bosses people around.",0
The BEST Thai iced tea in the Valley bar none!!! Excellent stir fried and curry dishes too. Love it!,0
I have flown in and out of PHX many times and have found it to be a nice airport. Well laid out with decent food options. Of course the weather here helps with its good reputation about being low on delays.,0
"meh... they have a lot of the standard expected whole food health support products, BUT if you want excellent service and need a helping hand searching for your nutriceuticals, I'd head straight over to Pure Health on Washington and Buffalo.",0
"Great service, amazing food.  The baked scallops were delicious.  The spicy tuna and salmon were creamy and had just the right amount of heat.",0
Greasy and quick should be the name of this place.. I ordered the Mongolian beef and it was drenched in oil.. it was disgusting.,0
The spices on the burger was too heavy. Yikes!,0

Ordered the baked bacon omelette. Way too much bacon for me. Didn't finish it. Won't be ordering that again.,0
"OK not great.  Nothing that significant to say that was bad about the experience, but comparatively not as great as other orchards (e.g. Door Creek).",0
"I've tried time and time again to like this place, but the pizza,,,hmmm..is mediocre at best...the pazookie ice cream cookie is great and so is the atmosphere..",0
this restaurant is not wheelchair accessible. I have no idea how the food is because there are 2 steps and no ramp.,0
The best goat curry and Kulfi!\nyum yum yum,0
"They make a decent pizza with ample toppings and a chewy crust. Better, their sauce is sweet!",0
What an amazing little place! Food is outstanding! Great dining experience! My husband and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary there and since then this restaurant is our favorite place,0

"Everything is kind of sub-par, except the pizza which might be good enough to be average. Eh.",0
"T-Bones is always a fun spot to hangout with a nice view of Lake Wylie, but I will say that the food is mediocre. The service is usually pretty good and the beer is cold.",0

"Nice and clean airport overall... enjoyable experience, except when you miss your flight and you're stuck there longer than expected.",0

"Flancer's has the most AMAZING sandwiches put that together with a great staff, that's what makes this one of my favorite places in town to eat!",0
"tuna sandwich was ok. (if you like cheap tuna dripping with more olive oil than 3 salads would need.) kind of pricey for a plain sandwich, no drink etc. bread was good but that was about it.",0
"It is unfortunate that this is closing, as it is the best fine dining in Madison.   I think that a lot of people don't recognize that they also have a smaller bar area with more affordable options that are excellent as well.",0
"Maybe I came on an off day but the service was slow, the Swedish pancakes were not fully cooked and the hostess ended up serving us more than the waitress. Don't think I'll be back again.",0
Terrific. Clean and many great color choices. \nClose to campus and all nail techs have tons of experience. Walk in or appointments. The prices are very reasonable.,0
It's a burger joint nothing more sadly I don't go there much. Reason is I find there burgers very very greasy and unimpressive. For the cost I would likely go some were else sadly.,0
They quit selling fried oysters! Couldn't tell me why either. The fried oysters were my favorite too....Dam!!!,0
Always been one of my favorite sandwich places I have been to.,0

I like their cheese and crust but this is a place to go more for the atmosphere than the actual food.,0
The guy who helped me spent a lot of time finding the right size helmet in the color I wanted. He was very helpful in sizing and also giving me direction on gloves and a tank bag. I would highly recommend this company.,0

"They have great food, they also have roaches",0

Can definitely find a better pizza place but when you're hungry and desperate... it'll do... well until the next morning.,0

"Best Thai food in Town. You might get shot outside, but food is worth the  risk",0

"Nice shoes, helpful staff, but pricey. Didn't find what we were looking for.",0
This place used to be the go to spot. Real Solid for the most part. Now the food is horribly bland and the egg rolls have some spice in them that is super nasty.\n\nSad,0

We love the popcorn here. Sometimes the picture isn't the greatest for the theater but overall we love to go here and get rewarded for our movie going so that is fun.,0
Pizza didn't live up to the hype. Pretty standard fare. The restaurant itself is cozy though I'm not a fan of the low ceilings and feeling trapped underground. Oops.,0

I love this place because the pasta is always very very very hot.,0

Food is fresh and delicious. Atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming. I loved it.,0
Ordered a pizza at night. Didn't let me know they were closed. Checked later they said they'd deliver at 11:00am. They didn't let me cancel. This place blows.,0
This place was MUCH better when it was the SOD,0
"Ordered the fish tacos with rice and beans. Bland, awful. Fish was overfried. Beans were not that wonderful smooth creamy texture that refried beans are supposed to be. Won't be going back.",0

"Its an Airport, it is okay but not the speediest to get out of.",0
Worst airline ever. Never on time and will drop you on the far end of airports completely opposite your connecting flight with barely anytime to spare. You get what you pay for I guess (it was the lowest cost flight for us).,0

"Service with Christopher was great, food was good! Salsa is too sweet and the fried ice cream wasn't freshly fried. Some minor changes would make this a great little place!!",0
For an airport restaurant the prices are very affordable while maintaining a great quality of food. I recommend trying out any of their salads.,0
Don't list their drink prices. Food was mediocre at best probably closer to 2.5 stars.,0

"My husband and I went to Pane Bianco when we were driving through Phoenix and we absolutely loved it! Incredible food, service and decor. Pane Bianco had a very warm and friendly vibe. The bread is to die for!",0
"Harris grill is lively, unpretentious, and has good food. Its patio is a great place to linger on a warm evening, and the bar and restaurant are good places for cheap food on colder winter nights.",0
What ever you do don't buy accessories cause they won't let return it or store credit after 14 days   Even if you just joined open 4 phones and bought 3 phones and you are only 2 days over your 14 days,0

The horchaitas are the best ive tasted... So far.,0
For breakfast the service was excellent. Although we did not order a big meal the food was good reasonably priced arrived very quickly. Cannot rate more as we did not order a huge biscuit and gravy breakfast.,0

It's hard 2 find a good Mexican Restaurant but I finally found 1. This little hole in the wall had one of the best GREEN pozole I've ever had. 4 sure going back to try the white pozole!,0
I can't imagine why anyone would shop elsewhere.  Service is great and a place I enjoy doing business.,0
"They lost stars due to allowing grown men use the \""FAMILY\"" dressing rooms to change and shower KNOWING that it's reserved for people with children under 17.  What does THAT tell you!",0

I guess I wasn't drunk enough food was horrible and service was fkn embarrassing it took so long just place the order and of course when we got it it was all wrong!!! Fuck this place,0

"Eh.  Not really that good.  The chicken wasn't well trimmed, and the pasta was nothing special.  I'll skip it in the future.",0
"I had the Cuban chicken sandwich, which was really good. The bread was done just like a Cuban sandwich down in Miami. The sweet potato fries were OK, the dipping sauce was good.",0
Love the wings and burgers here. If you are coming to eat have the wings or the burgers!!  Everyone is always really nice.,0
"Great little dive bar. cheap well drinks and beer, and def a late night spot.",0
We ordered two milkshakes and it took over 20 minutes. Service was not good. First and only time coming here,0
"A Sunday tradition... great dim sum, inexpensive, awesome.  \n\n'nuff said.",0
By far the best cigar/ pipe selection  with a lounge in the Pittsburgh area!  Great employees and very knowledgeable as well! A must to come by too!,0
Great location for someone new to the city. Your right in the middle of it all! Within walking distance of Charlotte's great bars & restaurants. The staff was very accommodating.,0
"Barber didn't listen to a word I said, cut it the way he wanted. Worse haircut I've ever had. Never going back.",0
This store has Coke Zero in their fountain offerings!,0

Service was horrible and food was mediocre at best~ won't be going back,0
Have fallen in love with their White Pizza with chicken on garlic butter crust! Highly recommend it.,0
"Copps is alright, but they are expensive.  They have a nice selection of produce, but their meat prices are high.",0
Really nice staff. The cheeseburger was nothing special but by no means bad at all. Had a few beers and they were pretty good as well. I'll return.,0
"Horrible injera, it was NOT warm or fresh at all. I have been to many Ethiopian restaurants. They explained that I must have gotten injera from places that serve fresh injera out the oven. Wth",0
Nice desert setting. Good for out of town guests.,0
The lunch service is absolutely horrible.  I work in the building so my co-workers like to eat here.  Soda is always flat and service is very inconsistent.,0
"I can not put enough positive words together to describe this restaurant! The staff, management, cocktails, food, and atmosphere are exceptional!! This is a definite enjoyable dining experience on all levels!",0
Pretty darn good overall. The garlic bread was AMAZING. The pasta was better than average. The decor was nice and comfortable. Looking forward to coming back soon.,0
They have really tasty wings and i LOVE their pizza! Delivery is always fast and they have coupons regularly in the paper. We really go here for the Hot Wings but they are so addicting and delicious that we can't help it!,0
"Great place, great service, reasonable prices.  Will do this again!",0
Not a family / kid friendly place. Food was bland and service was horrible. Would not recommend this place.,0
"This is the ABSOLUTE BEST Pizza in Henderson. The crust, sauce and toppings are amazing. I got the Super Six and loved it. I really like Metro Pizza but this is way better.",0
Best authentic Mexican food in Vegas! And the horchata is delicious! I have been to a lot of Mexican places that don't even compare. You have to try it to believe it!,0
"Food took forever, tacos were dried, beans were thick and chalky., chips and salsa tastes awful.  Will not go here  again.",0
"Despicable service at the bar, very selective about who they serve, and incredibly rude when you request service after they ignore you for 20 minutes.",0
"I like Applebee's food but the service at this location is really, really bad not once but twice.",0
"This place is quick and centrally located, but the food is pretty average. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but it's useful for when I'm in the area.",0
"Consistently fantastic Mexican food. I want to try something new, but the carnitas is so damn good.",0
Great pizza! Fresh ingredients and friendly service.\nPlenty of tables too since expansion,0
Wings were tasty! Pizza sauce had great flavor! Worth trying.,0
"I went back to pewter rose for breakfast, and the food was really not that great. I love the decor of the place, and the people that I met. My highlight of Breakfast was the butterscotch scones.",0
"You can never go wrong when it comes to the quality of Capriotti's sandwiches.  Excellent customer service, food is prepared in a timely manner and it tastes great!",0
Great doctor!!! The best staff and medical assistants. \nDr. Gabroy is very caring and thoughtful. His staff is just has great as him.,0
Not much to say but I like this place. The Thai style fried rice with crab or lobster meat is pretty good. Service is ok and ambiance is good.,0
This is what's sad about Charlotte. A chain restaurant with frozen pizza dough and sauce out of a can is voted the 3rd best restaurant in town?,0
Stop here! Buy a block of the dill Havarti and try a bunch of samples. I am sure there will be others that you love :),0
Spag Warehouse is the best value for money in the tri-state area.... damn good food!!,0
I've had dinner here so many times. But more recently it seems that the food quality and friendliness of waiters have deteriorated. The one thing that's consistently great is the bread.,0
Their UPS upcharge is the highest I have scene.  They charge almost double the normal UPS rate. Other UPS Stores upcharge is a lot less.,0
"I lived in Miami for many years, so I can say this was mediocre Cuban food with some authority. Not bad, but for what you got, the price was outrageous. For that kind of money, you could do some real fine dining.",0
"Very helpful, you never feel alone for the instructors are always available via cell...",0
Garlic bread delicious! Pizza phenomenal! Wish it was more like deep dish but crust tasted great! Staff was wonderful!,0
Can't go wrong with shepherd's pie and a Guiness.,0
Somehow I manage to keep coming back for their $5.50 pound of chicken wings and pitcher of Wisconsin beer.,0
Sales people are snobby and act like you know nothing about dance. I despise going here to get dance gear.,0
Love the salon but more so love Trini. He has fixed my hair and love the transitions my hair takes between my appointments! Plus the hair massages during the hair washes are amazing!,0
This Starbucks is in a great part of the Hilton Village. I live right down the street and come here often. My drinks are always perfect but this isn't the quickest Starbucks. If you are in a rush skip this location.,0
Great lunch menu very friendly people.  I always get the sesame chicken lunch special with fried rice.  Always a great experience!!!,0
"One of the best Steakhouses, always consistent. Great food and service. You can people watch at the bar",0
"I love this little place.  Good food, decent sushi, friendly service, and tasty thai tea.  Prices are good, and there's never a wait.",0
I don't get what people like about this place. It's generally crowded with rushed service and the food has yet to impress. I've tried at least twice -- maybe I'm ordering wrong but I really just don't get it...,0
Probably the worst run business I have ever dealt with in my entire life.,0
"Yakitori is really good here, the miso is soso, and the rest looked good, but i don't like sushi..the staff is really nice and all in all a fun place.",0
"Just tried the famous Kitchen Burger, was very disappointed. The bun fell apart, the burger was burnt, one waitress at lunch time. Took forever and was not worth waiting for. Won't be back...",0
"Service was terrible, completely oblivious attitude.  food quality not great, cheap ingredients and you can taste the difference plus they play annoying teenybopper music with douchey clientele",0
The description says this restaurant has waiter service... I beg to differ.  That's all I have to say about this one.,0
Dive bar filled with perverts and heroin addicts. Looks like an Intervention Convention. Bartenders are weathered and bitter. Food tastes bad and they charge way too much considering they are a dive bar and not a nightclub.,0
Just don't waste your time driving out to this one... Wigwam location is better..,0
This is the only pho place... taste is better than Lulu's that's pho sure.,0
The focaccias are great and Kendra is great. Our go place for after kid's games or to watch U of A.,0
"Beautiful course, Super friendly staff, and... WOW cheap beer! We will be back!",0
"The absolute best burger, $7.00 on happy hour.... I would order it if it wasn't happy hour!",0
Yummy! The braised duck gnocchi were out of this world! Our waitress was as nice as they get. Great experience!,0
"AMAZING. The white pizza, cheesesteak (chicken & beef), & deli sandwiches are great. I've never been disappointed. Expect to wait awhile sometimes, as this place gets busy! Well worth the wait though.",0
The staff here is awesome!  Great bar just off of state street that always has great prices on food and drinks.  If you want some good food without spending too much from a great staff this place is for sure worth a try.,0
The leather conditioner they used on my seats was rancid!!! It was sticky and left my car smelling like a nasty deep-drier.. Booooooo!!,0
"For a place that prides themselves on unique wine, that doesn't make up for the horrible service and complete lack of attention from the bartenders. Very disappointing.",0
This place is great and you can't beat the price. Sam's Town is going to be my new favorite hotel to visit when in Vegas. Mostly because of this buffet.,0
Great food! I loved the Tangerine Chicken! :),0
You know you have arrived in Las Vegas when there are slot machines in the airport.,0
"Great late night dinners good Vietnamese food, love their pho soups :)",0

"There salads are the best.  Love the Anderson Springs location, very fun to sit on the patio overlooking the water.",0
"This place is well organized, great for the kids, great for the parents and any of the family that would like to show up to the huge glass window show of cuteness.",0
"Scarlet is a hair designer from Korea, did a great job...expect to pay $30 minimum but is totally worth it.",0
Try the wet burrito. Enough food for 4 (yes I said 4) meals.,0
"After posting this review I received an email that they would like more feedback so I went to the link that was in the email, posted the same information and then never heard from them again.",0
"I ate way too much sushi here. It was so good, couldn't stop!",0
Best market in the world! I LOVE Sprouts!,0
Very friendly staff but not the best selection of gear and the price aren't the best. There are  better stores.,0
"Love this place. The service, food and salad bar are excellent. Great desserts too. Only downfall is the parking so carpool if in a group.",0
Thank you for a great happy hour! Def recommend! The bartenders were fantastic and attentive to my drink preferences (salted rims!) Head over there your next time on Mill Ave!,0
"Great authentic home style cooking. Fresh warm tortillas. Service with a smile and a great clean, bright atmosphere.",0
Loved the food! The service was also really good! The waiter made great suggestions when we asked and was knowledgeable and very helpful! Can't wait to go back!,0
"Good food. Excellent service. Little pricey for the quality, but the atmosphere totally makes up for that. Be prepared to share a meal. Huge servings!",0
"Sweet Baby Jesus... try the honey toast. Trust me, just try it.\n\nI'm having honey toast withdrawal symptoms already and it's only been a couple days.",0
"Apple pie, even cold, is wonderful. Nice taste of cinnamon, and a flaky sugar crust. Apples have own sweetness and each bite  is a celebration of \nflavor.",0
love this place!  By far the best mani/pedi I've ever gotten in Charlotte.  100% recommend,0
I loved the fries and the gyro wasn't as salty and greasy as other places I've had. I would definitely go during the day though. The place is kinda depressing....,0
First time here....and Im sure it won't be the last!,0
Awesome awesome awesome!!!! Do yourself  a favor & go experience the Detroit red wings you won't regret it.,0
Melissa and Steve's wedding; what a great time with family and friends.,0
"Slow service,terrible steak tacos (or should I call them grizzle tacos) loud crappy music,uncaring waitress and bartendress. Gave the place three chances,that's all they get.No more!!!",0
"The Lobster Roll Caesar Salad was very good, and the service at the bar was great!",0
The food was fine but the waitress had too many tables and and the sandwich came long after our drinks were gone 20-30 min. we won't go back!,0
"Still our favorite restaurant in the entire Valley. The freshest homemade food- always perfect, the ambiance & the true care & hospitality of the exceptionally kind owners are what draws us to this wonderful eatery. Absolutely 5 stars in every category.",0
Super Nachos and Ranchero eggs hit the spot!\n\nIf you find yourself in Henderson (on the way to Lake Mead perhaps?!) this is worth the detour!,0
"I love this Waffle House, not only is it close by but the staff is great and the food is good...",0
I love the pad thai it's so yummy and their thai iced tea is too bomb  the best thai food I ever tasted,0
I love love love my new iron gate that they customized for us! Their service is great and did an awesome job installing our gate! It's truly a work of art! I will highly recommend them!,0
"Best fish taco I've had outside of San Diego.  Service is fast and courteous, cheap drinks and the corn salsa is fantastic.",0
Would not eat here owner rude after checking in they would not accept the $10 off coupon offered by this yelp app. Service was not poor food way to over priced!!!!,0
Poor quality food of inconsistent flavors - rice was bland while chicken and brocolli was overly garlicy.,0
"Not bad.  Not great.  But not bad.   Excellent bang for your buck, especially if you're hungry.",0
Great food. Nice Lighting. Attractive bartenders. Amazingly concocted martinis. Love this place.,0
I highly recommend the beef bowl entree and iced almond milk tea if it's your first visit and don't want to get something you're unsure of. The brick toast is also something yummy to try out.,0
"the food wasn't very good, and the organ player didn't seem to know any of the songs we requested.",0
Amazing service and really friendly staff!!! Very much recommended!!,0
I go here all the time (about 4 times a month) and i have never had a bad meal or bad service.,0
If you have never dined here it is a must at least once. The pizzas are excellent and the salads are very good. But you must top off with a pazooki.,0
Pretty mediocre food it is not worth the price.  I would actually go elsewhere to eat that much better for the same price.,0
My new place for Italian! Service was over the top and the food was excellent! Would recommend to anyone,0
"As the reviews of Casbah appear to be particularly long-winded... the place is nice, fancy, organic-ish, alternating menu, nice atmosphere. Good date restaurant. Good food-lovers restaurant.",0
"Thai Cuisine is a good Thai restaurant, but the atmosphere is lacking. It feels akin to eating in a high school teachers' lounge (including the musical selections).",0
music can be a lot of fun. food not so good,0
Good dim sum. Average selection with everything u would expect but nothing g to really set it a part either.,0
Love this bar. Mike is the best bartender here! Karaoke on Friday nights and awesome drink specials. I always have a blast here!,0
"This store is CLOSED - It closed its doors on December 31, 2014.",0
"My go to Pho place when in Vegas, but there can be a long wait sometimes. Food is good, service not so much.",0

"Food was mediocre at best, place seems kind of dirty. Wouldn't recommend.",0
"Great pizza, quick service, friendly staff, good prices,  large portions. We'll definitely be back!",0
I have been seeing Dr. Taylor for 10 years. She is a caring doctor who listens and has always returned calls and been easy to get into see even last minute. Thank you Dr. Taylor:),0
My favorite so far is the Shrimp Bowls. Yummy!,0
Amazing staff and doctor.  I've been seeing Dr. Larsen for years and trust his diagnosis.,0
"Very mediocre. Salsa is spicy, but no fajitas, sauce covered sloppiness. Not coming back.",0
"they took real good care of our Lucy cat...and were very professional and honest.  very small location, so don't be fooled or put off by the front.",0
"Food was good, service was not as I expected, and felt very crowded due to the small area.",0
"The entire staff was friendly, prompt, and efficient. My water glass was always full. Recommend the shrimp fried rice. It was delicious and my preteen son chowed it down. Would definitely return.",0
I always get the homemade turkey sandwich with peppers.  Peppers are the business!  The peppers make your mouth burns a lil but then again I don't handle spiciness well.,0
"The ice cream is good, although they use mini marshmellows rather than marshmellow swirl in their rocky road, not my thing.The atmosphere is kitchy; very pink.",0
"I was there last night, two words - CHOCOLATE CAKE! Try it. The cream cheese frosting was an awesome touch with the wonderfully moist cake.",0
there lemon chiken is good.also the wor wonton soup is very good. this place is not fancy but for the price its a good value.,0
"friendly and fast baristas, this is one of my favorite starbucks in the valley :).",0
"Bad food, bad service. We will not be back.",0
"If you use Discount Tire once, you will never go to another tire shop...they are just that good.",0
Great pub to drink at. Good happy hour app specials. Don't pass up the Guinness wings but don't expect the same food quality in all the items from the past. Fado's has had better days.,0
This is a great old school steak house in Las Vegas. I loved it...,0
The food here is just good not great.  Pricing is great for the large portions of food.  Overall a good experience.,0
"good finds, i found a tie that was 2.00 on sale looked brand new, i looked it up , it was going for $125.00 so you should go and just see what they have...",0
Very cool family trip not a lot of activities and the costumed employees acted  like we were actually bothering them. Never the less it was fun and my daughter liked it,0
"There is nothing Chicago-ish about the foods here.  I'm from Chicago, and not a single thing on the menu reminded me of home.  Plus the staffing and service is horrible, and is overpriced for what little you get.",0
"Basic dive with boiled dogs, some toppings, and french fries.  No frills served on Styrofoam plates.  Interesting throw back to days gone by and that's their hook.",0
"Great place for horseback riding!  Debbie and Mike are awesome, nice gentle horses and beautiful ride!  Definitely would highly recommend this stable for a great time!",0
"this place has gone down hill, everything taste bland, go to archies instead. it is worth the drive",0
The Pita Jungle in Tempe is by far the best PJ around!  Love their food - the hummus is the best I've ever had.,0
"I didn't like the Pho there. I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland. I also had the Bun Bo Hue. I like the side sauce that they gave but, without it, again it would taste very bland.",0
I've recalled my memory of having some good pizza from Larry and Carol's and looked forward for another good one but my expectation has been completely shattered. I thought I've placed order at different restaurant but it sure was Larry and Carol.,0
If you choose to go with the mexican side of the menu its disgusting. Everything is slop on a plate. No one should come here and pay these prices.,0
"Hadn't eaten here in many years, but this last visit confirmed my recollection of their first-rate food. Artful presentation, excellent food, and attentive service make this a near must when visiting Phoenix.",0
"Great friendly service every time, I recommend the ancho citrus shrimp burrito and the blackened mahi mahi fish taco. Solid visit every time I decide to stop by.",0
This is the thinnest crispiest crust I have ever seen and they serve it with a fork and knife. I love it!,0
This location is closed.\nThis location is permanently close as in out of business.,0
Crappy donuts. Rude workers. They almost seemed pissed when you want to buy a donut. There are a ton of good donut places around but this is not one of them.,0
"To begin, the service was great.  However, the ravioli seemed frozen and the meatballs in the spaghetti and meatballs were flavorless.  A lackluster meal all around.",0
"It is Hooters, you'll get the same food and beer at every location. They have a great happy hour and not so great food. Good eye candy, and sports on. What more is there to say?",0
Oh my...dont like the food here. Tried the Pad thai and the chicken fried rice...the pad thai was disgusting and the fried rice was not enticing either...wont be going back...ugh,0
"Good food, good service, good time....Same place as the one on Mill Ave.\n\nGreat for dinner on the patio.",0
40minutes and still waiting for one slice of cheese- they told me it would be ready in 25 when I called,0
I love this place. The fried dumplings are to die for.,0
Service was very friendly. But this location needs a deep cleaning. It is very dirty with dirty bathrooms. Cleanliness is not a priority for this location,0
"Bland, bland, bland. \n\nAnd greasy.",0
"Very expensive, but very, very awesome. Extensive winelist, attentive waiters, delicious food, great mood lighting, wonderful location. I will definitely be going back.",0
"Chips were tasteless, pretty sure my enchiladas were made with Alfredo sauce. Nothing was fresh, just loaded with fat.",0
"Wonderful place for nails. Erica is a perfectionist - your nails will look their absolute best. Reasonably priced,  clean,  and friendly.",0
My favorite pizza in Pittsburgh. Very very thick cheese. Many many toppings. I like meat ball best! Try it!,0
The Service Technician was really good but they charged me $145.00 for a ten dollar part.,0
"I definitely would not recommend this Pizza Hut. Getting pizza here is a real gamble, but what makes it even worse is that some of the employees, especially the manager, are real jerks.",0
Food was good. Service was slow. Did not receive my appetizer and took 20 minutes for my free dessert with the Yelp coupon.,0
"Prices were cheap however food was served well after others who came in and they literally put Brown gravy on the Mexican food, staff ignored simple requests...only reason for 1 star was due to price",0
"Very cool old place in the industrial part of town.  I wish it wasn't surrounded by two strip clubs (made for interesting conversation with young kids) but the food was pretty good, not greasy at all.",0
"We always feel comfort and compassion when our dogs are in need.  All the staff are knowledgeable and caring. \nEven when our pets had passed, the staff did everything possible to help us with our grief.",0
Incredibly rude staff and the food is nothing special.  I definitely do not recommend this place.,0
avoid this place like the plague. if you stay here...avoid the casino area between 10pm -2am that's when this place gets really sketchy.,0
For a Mall that's closing down and doesn't have any anchor stores left it's ok for what it is- although the mall is dead there are still some specialty shops that one could go to if they really needed something,0
Crockett's raw honey is now available at Costco for $8.99 for 3 lb (about a quart!) Yay!,0
"Food is decent and the wait is much, much better than Olive Garden on a Friday night. Service was OK. If it is authentic Italian that you're wanting, you're not getting it here or the Olive Garden...",0
"This is a great hotel.  The rooms are clean and modern, the fitness center is well equipped and there is free wi-fi.",0
Food is average. The Nile and Middle Eastern Cafe are much better.,0
I work in the industry; needed to get nose pad replacements for expensive wire frames I wear everyday; they charged me 24 dollars with tax;  I could get them for free at most optical shops;  enough said.,0
If your looking for Philly sandwiches in Vegas. This is a good stop. As close as your going to get. They also have Wise potato chips and TastyKake.,0
the drinks here are soooo good. as for the food.....eh,0
The bartender from Chicago was awful. He was rude and did not deserve our service. Overall we did not have a good experience at this restaurant and ended up using his tip on a bartender at another restaurant in the area. stay away.,0
Awesome! Pizza and zucchini and mozzarella sticks.  Great service always!!!!!,0
"The best sandwich shop around,veggie friendly and unique menu.everything is good and fresh.the gooey balls are the best",0
The goulash was (sickeningly) sweet and the bread pudding wasn't sweet at all.  But the atmosphere is kind of cool.  And the prices are downright cheap.,0
This is terrible.  The food is very bland and service is very slow.  The employees act like they're the only restaurant in town.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one.,0
"This place is really cool. Good price older hotel. Its very clean. They also give you free wifi, and no Resort Fees.",0
"As of 9/28/14, the Happy Hour prices have now doubled.\nDrinks during 10-11 AM and 5-7 PM are now 2.00 plus tip",0
"Perfect place to have a quick bite to eat if you're in the mood for Mexican food, and the chimichangas are delicious!",0
"Cheap beers, and Irish Nachos are awesome.",0
Super high pressure sales guy who became an ass when I didn't purchase his $165 sealant.,0
"I used to go here all the time when I lived in Tempe. Always open seating, consistently good food and the price is right. Can't wait to visit again when I am back in town this winter!",0
"Always impressed with the service, food, and variety.  They win!",0
I love this Ulta! It's always clean and bright. The staff is very helpful. The coupons are the best and the free gifts are always so cute :),0
Cute little free museum in the heart of Scottsdale! The staff are super friendly and knowledgeable!  I could spend a whole day chatting with them! You must walk through if you are in town!,0
My Grandson loves it says burgers are bigger and better then other fast food places but I find the price you pay for a meal you could go to a restaurant and get full service for the same price or less.,0
"You really can't ever go wrong with Cheesecake Factory  no matter what city you're in.  (Though I've found the one in Northern NJ and in Phoenix is better than Baltimore) Big menu, decent eats, and affordable.",0
The food was good but everything except for the shrimp balls were cold. There are better dim sum here in Las Vegas,0
"Thr menu looked great but delivery took forever. Over 1 1/2 hours.  The food was cold.  Must be why it tasted so mediocre.   Are you listening,  Rosati's.",0
One of the best zoo setups I've ever seen. The zoo is setup as a perfect loop so you don't have to select a path and then go down another route late. It's a giant circle which means you never miss an animal!,0
Great spot for outdoor business meal.  Limited vegetarian options.,0
Awesome prices. Delivery included setup so that was a plus since we got an entire bedroom set. Would shop here again.,0
I think the food is pretty decent. But my Taiwanese friend said that this place is the closest to authentic Chinese/Taiwanese food.,0
The hotel itself is nice but the rooms were so loud! Paper thin walls and loud maintenance crew really detracted from the quality of the stay.,0
Had some great breakfast service. Spacious. Good pricing. Clean.,0
I have tried repeatedly to get this company to refund an incorrect amount charged to my mother who died.  There is no email and I have spent hours on the phone.  USE any other service if you can.,0
This place deserves more than 3.5 stars! I was pleasantly surprised! Very good food and great atmosphere!,0
Just your typical mall.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  It was kept pretty clean as well and had a large amount of parking.,0
Great staff and they're more than willing to make any customized drink at your request.,0
"It's your standard american chinese food place, and they deliver. I like the food at Dragon City better, especially the chicken dishes, but this place delivers and they don't.",0
They put so much cream cheese on the bagel that you can barely taste the bagel. And I'm okay with that.,0
I love a hotel where the cashier sits behind bulletproof glass.  Nothing makes me feel safer.,0
Absolutely love this nail salon! Everyone there was so nice and welcoming. This salon is definitely going to be a place that I will be going to more often.,0
"The food was bland, the cheese dip reminded me of cheese wiz and after seated I waited over 15 minutes just to give my drink order.  The only good thing was the chips...not going back.",0
"We love this place & I have been to San Diego, St. Louis, Chicago, etc. Our favorite by far!",0

I have been very pleased coming here. Their beer/wine/liquor selections are wonderful. Food and coffee is also great. Will be back here for sure.,0
A big black Cockaroach ran across the the counter when we were placing our order. we stop the order and went to Jack in the Box down the street.  I would not go back!  Stay away!,0
"The tacos were great but all the sides that go along with them lacked flavor. The d\u00e9cor and feel of the restaurant was great, but only half of a meal with taste is not a good enough reason to go back",0
One of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix.  Easy on my waistline and delicious!,0
We didn't even get to eat! The hostess skipped over us and made us wait over an hour before we left.,0
Went to an event here. The meatballs were frozen meatballs. It was ok. I probably wouldn't go back to eat.,0
"There are 2 types of \""Good\"" restaurants in Pittsburgh. There is Yinzer good and Actually good. This food is Yinzer good. Way too much butter and sugar. Yuck.",0
ok food but most of it is frozen or canned and the ribs gave me the shits.,0
The worst restaurant ever! It doesn't matter if the food tastes good or not.. The service is the worst! Lazy and slow as ever!,0
"I love Trader Joes but this one always has the longest check out lines.  Other than that, it's great.",0
Only eat ribs here. Anything else you will be very disappointed. The only good point is...its cheap.,0
The customer service was outstanding. The food was mediocre... But my mother in law loves going here so I had to try it myself.,0
"Not the best Hooters I've been to, but the wings were great as usual! The staff wasn't the friendliest, but I was not let down by the mozzarella sticks!",0
"Prompt service, great pho. I eat pho all the phoking time and this was amazing! the cream cheese wontons and the egg rolls were fairly decent, standard fried stuff.",0

"This \""pizza\"" was the worst food I have ever eaten.",0
"Had the large Angus beef and cheese, was pleasantly shocked at the size of it, I've got a big appetite and it was filling for even me.  Outstanding customer service, mind numbing sandwich. Will definitely be back again.",0
The veggie chili is really yummy. They also have fantastic salads.  Very good happy hour and nice servers.,0

It's Mimi's.  There the same everywhere.,0
This place sucks. The service is horrible. The hostess this evening (Feb 11) was horrible: rude and detached. The Manager was worse. Do not patronize this restaurant unless you have money to burn and time to kill.,0
This place is excellent price wise and has a decent variety. My only complaint is the setup of the seating...check it out...\n\nABRA...,0
Overall felt like the food lacked flavor. The jambalaya and gumbo seemed blah to both of us. The BBQ shrimp and cornbread were both good.,0
The 1st rule of the Breakfast Club is not never talk about the Breakfast Club. The 1st rule of the Breakfast Club is NEVER eat at the Breakfast Club. The 2nd rule is NEVER talk about the Breakfast Club.,0
Not much to choose from but you only pay 7$ including drink. Noodles are the best dish. Eveything else is ok. Its good for a work time lunch,0
"The staff was nice, the prices were not horrible and all.  Only down side is I was expecting to be able to be done but that's not something they're set up for.",0

A fun place to go with very friendly staff. Definitely attracts an alternative crowd!,0
This store focuses on store policies than customer service.,0

Radio Shack does not honor the manufacture warranty unless you purchase the extended warranty from Radio Shack.  I will NEVER purchase anything from Radio Shack again and recommend that you don't either!,0
Food was above average but i will definately come back for the great pico de gallo salsa!,0
Tried the fish tacos and they weren't really exciting. The place seems like a nice place to hang out and grab some drinks with friends but it's not worth a special trip.,0
Really could go 3 1/2 but the fact that they are priced great and have chow fun in different variations has made me a fan.  Plus they deliver.,0
"awful, food is bad and there is nogood service.",0
Decent airport with recently upgraded food options.  Concourses can get quite crowded during peak times and rental car shuttle can be a pain.,0

"We have been going here for years. Service is ok, but the food has gone downhill. Too bad. Use to love this place.",0

I went here once to get my pants hemmed and got yelled at for not purchasing proper pants in the first place. I was too startled to respond but have since thought of many  witty replies. Oh well.,0
Mother's Day brunch. Short rib and Salmon both expertly prepared and fabulous. Large chilled shrimp and crab claws fantastic. All good but way overpriced. Will look elsewhere going forward.,0
"The sushi was excellent, and has a fun and inventive atmosphere.",0

This place is okay nothing really good to talk about.,0

Best pizza in Phoenix! Love the thin crust pizza. Very close to being east coast. Three thumbs up!,0
I think there are better options in the Downtown area. The service was great but the Loco Moco was cafeteria-style.,0
"Great location, awesome outdoor bar, but the clientele and I hate to say it, bar-staff, are pretty trashy. It's weird..",0
"Awesome stuff!  Huge menu for such a tiny place.  Great margaritas, excellent, somewhat authentic food for a decent price.  Check the chalkboard for daily specials...they're usually real good.",0

The food was good enough. The service was so slow I got irritated. I felt ignored by the hostess and waitress I will not be going back.,0

Definitely not stingy on the meat! The hot corned beef and the baked potatoes are delicious.,0
Wanted a Pedicure and figured I'd give this place a try since it was across the street from my hotel.,0
Just had my eyebrows waxed by Courtney. She was great and I love the results! My eyebrows look awesome & sexy! I will definitely go back!,0
Incredible Italian food. Mushroom appetizer is just phenomenal. So is the mozzarella cheese. Great fish. Expensive but worth it!,0
Great place for happy hour with fantastic prices and the food was really good!  Very nice service as well.,0
Best breakfasts in the Pittsburgh area.  Just make sure to bring cash - they don't take credit.,0
Cool little dive bar with friendly staff. Drinks were well made and the perfect strength.,0
The Hostess Was A HUGE BITCH! The food was not terrible but I will never go back after how rude the night hostess is.,0
"The staff here was quite friendly, but the fact that people love Monical's pizza leads me to believe they have never had pizza before.  Its awful cardboard with some sauce and cheese on top.",0
I have just had one of the BEST meals of my life. We ate at L'Etoile Restaurant in Madison. And not just that the food was great... the service and attention to detail was remarkable. WOW.,0

"A little over priced, but loved that we were able to get up close and personal with the animals..better than most Zoo's",0
Best pizza joint in Phoenix. No one ever leaves this place hungry. Top notch.,0
Food isn't too bad. Service is miserably slow for a slow Sunday even with the ironman event in town. Not really worth the $$$. No beer selection either.,0
Worst Cab Service ever. Ronda was the RUDEST person ever on the phone. Please someone just put them out of service already.,0
"Dude this place is awesome!!! The staff is incredible especially Scott, who has some amazing stories from his days touring with KISS and other bands. The prices are great!",0

The pawn shop just has a bunch of crap and the staff is rude and stupid. It is not nearly ad interesting as it is on tv,0
Prices have gone through the roof! I was quoted $350 and then I was handed a $570 bill.,0

Had cheese and sausage with onion pizza. Crust was limp and doughy. Italian salad was average. Not my kind of pizza,0
"Be warned! As soon as you tap on a \""premium app game\"" on the tablets provided on the tables,.99 cents will automatically be added to your bill.",0
Found a place plastic coated wire in my food delivered last night. I'm disgusted and will never eat this food again!,0

The bourbonzola burger is outstanding and I'm pretty sure they have a little old southern lady trapped on the kitchen because the chicken fried chicken is too notch!,0
The food is good. Portion size is BIG! Wait-time during lunch hours is kind of long. Restaurant is clean and staff is friendly enough. \nDefinitely a recommendation.,0
I had a fish sandwich on a Friday afternoon. It was very average. Thinking this isn't the thing for this place though...,0
"The pesto was lacking flavor. I was really hoping they would live up to their name, but highly disappointed. Their pasta was good though as well as their pie.",0

Doc was great! Very friendly and super informative. I have been to a few doctors in town and he was by far the best.,0
"Once again, you cant beat Papa Johns pizza, especially when they are on sale. Quick online ordering & quick (usually) delivery. Pizza always arrives hot, as I ordered it, and tasty.",0
"Va Dang is pretty darn delicious. I prefer Pho Thanh, but thats my taste. I like the broth better at Pho Thanh, however Va Dang has way better deserts available.",0

Hands down best vets in coolidge! Very friendly and always do a great job with our dogs every time!,0

"Great hospital, very clean and easy to get around.  Beautiful decorations...good food too.  Friendly staff.",0
The pizza is ok. The tomato chunks are delicious and the pepperoni too. But they don't bake it and the stuff all slides off the crust. Overloaded too much with cheese. Not horrible but certainly not the best.,0
"I went looking for a puffy taco like I'd find in San Antonio, TX. Close but not the same. Indian fry bread was a little breadier than I hoped for but still pretty darn good!",0

bartender was awesome. She took good care of me and the food was excellent. I am on a low carb diet and she ordered my meal just the way I wanted it without any issues. I would return here again.,0
used to be my favorite place now since new ownership the food and service is very poor!,0
Think Panera Bread with more of a coffee shop feel.,0
Slow service but overall quality of sushi was decent. I would have had a better experience if the five other waiters on the other side of the restaurant helped the one person serving our party of 11. Service needs some work,0
I don't understand what is so great about this place. I got the tacos and it was one of the worst that I ever had. I just moved here and still searching for a great taco place.,0
Can't believe they sell nazi items here.  Will never be back as well as their customer service and knowledge was  very poor.,0

The food is good but the service is absolutely HORRIBLE! Took 10 mins to order drinks and an hour to get our food. The waiters are slow and business is under staffed.,0

Great service! Mike is a great bartender and Joey is top notch! Reverse happy hour is unbeatable with half off drinks and good!,0

"This is one of the few things that I enjoyed in Phoenix.  Actually, there is nothing else except the baseball stadium, and lots of spring training stadia...otherwise, Phoenix sucks...A city?   I think not...",0
"I have been here twice, and while the food is good and the service is excellent, I have to agree with the first reviewer that for the money I could have been more impressed.",0
The food was okay. The noise level--with 10 people in a huge room--deafening. Awful acoustics!,0
Terrible. Some of the worst service and worst pizza I've ever had.,0
"Took forever to get one of the worst salad, hamburger, French fry lunches ever, would give it no stars if I could",0
"Although there were open seats, the waiteress took forever to seat us. The table we sat at was not clean and the service was terrible",0
"Typical greasy spoon. Dive looking, average cooking and friendly staff.",0
"Just had the Capistrami with no Russian Dressing and it was delicious. If you like spicy, add the hot pepper relish for extra flavor!",0
"It makes me sad that Peacemeal closed. It was a great idea and the food was pretty damn good.  Peace out, Peacemeal.",0
I have eaten here twice and both times the rice and chicken were fantastic. The cooking performance was entertaining both times I was here. I cannot give it a five because of the charge incurred for splitting a plate.,0
"The Superstition Mountains are a great way to get out of the city and enjoy Arizona. Lots of saguaro on ocotillo, with all kinds of trails for all kinds of hikers. A must see when you're in Phoenix!",0
"Place is dirty,  most if not all of the tables need to be wiped down.  Had to sit at a dirty table.  Yuck!",0
"Just another liberal bias rag.   It's only redeeming use, is for lining bird cages and starting fires.",0
"Well let's make it simple, I love their Bakery especially the bread and they are very nice, but the only problem i see is the bad smell the moment I go inside.",0
Best brewery food in the valley- pumpkin porter is awesome- good consistent food- lots of tvs for watching sports!,0
"I think that this is the best Chinese restaurants in phoenix, the great taste like home. And not only delicious food, and the service is also very good.",0
Love Brooksies - for propane but also BBQ essential. They have a friendly knowledgeable staff and their prices are competitive.,0
"On a recent visit, I noticed the Chinese menu was no longer available.  I managed to order one off-menu item but unfortunately it did not taste like it should have. Found the overall experience disappointing compared to previous visits.",0
Reuben sandwich was a joke.  Guy was friendly.,0
"TSA personnel seem like robots, yelling their 'required announcements' in a monotone voice to hundreds of people daily. They certainly arent friendly but i guess what can you expect from an place that deals with some many jerk daily?!?",0
I absolutely love Scottsdale gun club!!! The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. Ladies shoot free on Monday nights ;),0
"Went here last night with my parents and while the whole meal was delicious, the blueberry cobbler was definitely my favorite part. I don't even like blueberries and I would eat that morning, noon and night if I could.",0
"Went there last night, great concept, good looking food... Tasteless and bland.",0
"Stopped in for lunch. I had the crab cake sandwich. It was, honestly, the best crab cake sandwich I've ever had. EXCELLENT",0
"Love this place!  Great Bloody Mary's, Wings, and watching football.",0
I ordered a BBQ steak burrito & found it pretty bland and lacked some variety.  I've had better burritos.  Won't be going there anytime soon. :-(,0
They are crooks & bamboozled me for a meal that I did not even enjoy! Beware of their pricing and I will never eat there again!,0
"Nice people, I left a fitted hat for dry cleaning and it came back shrunken 3 sizes and misshapen. Maybe dry cleaning a baseball cap is too advanced for them.",0
"Great staff, lots of knowledge of Vegas history, extensive product available for the home gamer. Henry and Al made us feel welcome and taken care of.",0
They've been always so great with the kids on a tour. Loved coming back year after year...,0
Its a Subway. Nice & Clean. But the service is usually awful. Really unfriendly management. The employees seem to hate being there.,0
"Breakfast sandwich. Taylor ham. Sourdough, home fries.  That's what you need to get!! Great service!  Awesome menu!",0
Love this airport. It may not be the largest international airport but it sure does have a great selection of restaurants (inside and outside of security) and it is very easy to navigate.,0
Big airport with many electric walkways that makes it easy to go the long distances between gates.  The Atriums have white rocking chairs. Many trees as well line the main atrium.,0
"Overpriced subs, bread and meat has changed to low-grade. Same quality as subway, just a higher price tag. Will not visit again.",0
"I have always had good experiences here- the burgers, chicken sandwich, fries, and chili are good. The quality seems better than McDonalds.",0
"What happened to this place? \n\nService was bad this time, wings were choking-ly dry! 2 months before yesterday the burger was gross but service was good. They used to have better food!",0
"Good location, friendly staff, easy access.  In and out in under 5 minutes.",0
It's ok they have a great selection of things for you aquarium but the fish selection is so so and prices on pumps filter etc are out of control.,0
Nice on the inside but employees and other customers are not pleasant. Recommend staying away.,0
"Best variety of fruit / pit / exotic trees, with (hopefully) appropriate chill hours for our region.",0
"If I absolutely MUST eat fast food, I choose BK because they carry a veggie burger (vegan if you hold the mayo). Their fries are also vegan and fried separately from the meat products :)",0
"For Persian food it was pretty good.  Persian food is one of my favorites.  However the portion size of the kebabs was small.  Great rice, great mustomusir.  I will be back.",0
Make sure you check the price I saw them charging more than the listed price and brought it to there attention to no avail,0
Great Restaurant with great food nice wine. The inside ambience is good but there's no nice view of the city.,0
My go to delivery Chinese spot..from that category you gotta know what to expect but the Wok definitely steps it up over any other delivery place that I know of in the area.,0
Many changes since the manager change. Not all the new people up to speed. Hope it gets better,0
Make sure you leave AMPLE time to get to and from the airport. The rental car facility is literally miles from the actual airport. One of the furthest I've been to.,0
"Delicious sandwiches, cute boys, and kool-aid. I likey.",0
Food just ok average but loved the service and especially our waiter Adam. That's a plus. We will come back and ask for our waiter Adam.,0
Bar food at it's finest in the westside of Las Vegas!!! Chef's Brian and Lonnie are great and barstaff and waitstaff are too fantastic too!! Best pattymelt in town!!! if in the area check them out!!,0
Very clubby. Good steaks. Excellent service. Expect to pay premium prices,0
"They are usually very friendly and the restaurant is a very nice environment. However, the last couple of times I went in, it was very busy and the service and food was not that great.",0
My technician was both professional and personable.  Very easy and satisfying experience with Safelite.,0
I love Zoe's.  The food is always good and the service is always pleasant.,0
"Always good, the katsu chicken is great, they ran out of manapuas, bummer, eating some fried saimin noodles this time, best Hawaiian with out going to the islands.",0
"They close at 9pm with a 24 hour window after that.  So if you're hoping to pop in late just to say you did, check their hours first.",0
"Chicken was good, salad was tasty and the California roll and soup were not enjoyable.  This place wouldn't last in LA. Checked out the sushi in the case and went with a safe option.",0
Everything is always great here- food and service! I love their chips and salsa. This is where I take out of town visitors for Mexican food and it's always a hit.,0
"Yes, nice folks, nice store.  Questionable jewelry repair.  Disorganized, no personalized concern or individual responsibility.  Have had trouble with misplaced pieces that sit for weeks and a bracelet damaged in the store.",0
"I ordered the yellow curry with chicken and it was so delicious! I would have given 5 stars, but the egg roles were pretty greasy and flavorless.",0
Nice hotel/rooms. Food all around the area. $15/day for internet is a joke!,0
"Extremely friendly staff, very comfortable decor, and delicious food!  I enjoyed a sampling of a few different mezes and a greek salad - just wonderful!",0
"this is not burger king they used there name I like the real burger king so don,t go there",0
"Hugo's is an exceptional place to go & eat, & relax. It is old Las Vegas. A place where adults can get away. The food is great, as is the service. Everything about Hugo's is wonderful.",0
"Get here early for lunch...they get filled up. Sandwiches are great as is the soup.  I have moved from Charlotte, but I have never found an egg salad that competes.",0
"Don't bother with this company, he was scheduled to do work for me and was a no call, no show and won't answer his phone.",0
Came out to see Rocco DeLuca and fell in love with Deep Eddy Sweet Tea Vodka.,0
"If I can avoid flying into McCarran I will, and Henderson Executive is the place to go. Friendly staff and great location make this a great spot for ingress and egress from Sin City.",0
The food sucks shrimp is paper thin and hard small cup of coleslaw the potato chips are great but come e four bones on per cook ribs cheese sauce is ok bit come bathroom is trashed,0
"Great place to get a cut. The gentlemen here are actual barbers with skill. This is an actual barber shop, not a place for hoodlums to hang out it. Great job guys!",0
Cheap rates for driving range balls. Could use some more grass on the range though!,0
"This Denny's is a little out dated, but service and food is what you come to expect. Recommend!",0
Very crowded! Go to the one on Central. Way better IHOP.,0
This is the best place for real authentic Mexican food. Not a fancy place but the food is amazing!,0
"Sone of the best pizza in Arizona.  I'm from NY so I can't say best ever... Haha,  but very good and won't be disappointed.",0
"My go to place for Mexican food. Chimichangas, enchiladas and menudo are my favorites. Big portions, decent price.",0
"Don't waste your time... Ick! It's already dry enough in Arizona, don't think we need our food like that too...",0
Menu is fine. Beers are not cheap but I love the beer tour.,0
"\""Farren's has the best burgers in town.\""",0
"Considering the location, it's not too bad. Not the best Chinese food I've ever had but not horrible. It's somewhere in between Panda Express and real authentic Chinese food.",0
I went on a bad day. They had a discounted entrance fee of $3 and only one exhibit open! I was finished within an hour and left feeling very disappointed...,0
"Service was not very good took to long to get our meals about 45 minutes and the dessert we ordered never came just promises that it would, we finally got tired of waiting after an additional 45 minutes of promises, we will not be going back.",0
The food was so good that I don't want to brush my teeth for a month at the off chance a fleck of meat might drop on my tongue,0
Nothing special. My braised meat was dry and my husbands pasta was bland.,0
"I love this little dive. Amazing patrons and friendly bartenders. Always had an enjoyable time here. If you are a fan of dive bars, this place won't disappoint.",0
Worst airport I've ever been to hands down. I travel the world and have been to 100+ to compare.  Only place that sucked nearly as bad was Atlanta but only because of the long walks.,0
Food has always been delicious every time that I have gone here. Unfortunately the service is not very good. I only return because I love the food.,0
"LOVE this place!!  They have everything authentic Italian you could want without being in Italy!  Got some Gouda, sopressata and olives. Always love visiting here when in town!",0
Best Bartenders in Arizona. Friendliest owners also. Great spot for music and hanging out,0
"Went to dinner tonight and got horrible service, nothing worse than serving you a semi-warm overpriced beer in a warm glass. Food was ok way overpriced.",0
"I am so disappointed! I love Ross in general, but this one is limited, cluttered,and had no toilet paper in the single bathroom - after repeated requests! Won't return to this location.",0
Awesome! Great home cooked food. The watermelon salad with pickled rind and goats cheese is a gluten free DELIGHT!,0
"Really nice property with spacious and clean rooms, amazing outdoor space with 2 inviting pools! And when you factor in $50 bucks/night on Priceline, it's murder I tell ya!",0
"Extremely average pizza. The server was very nice and helpful, but the pizza was nothing special.",0
Arrived at 11pm to be told that they oversold the hotel and sent us elsewhere further away. The manager on duty said its there policy to overbook the rooms. It looked unclean and the staff clueless. Avoid at all costs.,0
We have been going here almost daily for years.  Love the coffee and bagels.\nNice community of regulars that we have gotten to know.\nThe Dutch Apple Bagel is the best!,0
"Good food, decent priced lunch menu.  Definitely recommend!",0
I stopped in because I saw the Grand Opening sign at their new location.  This was my first visit to Napoli & I probably won't return considering that the pizza and lasagna were only average and pricepoints were a little high.,0
"Using Homer's for nearly 10 years now, always great job for my 10+ year old cars. My ex-gf liked them too: they refilled her steering oil without charging her.",0
"Dear owner of Gus's,\n\nPlease go out of business and open a Starbucks in your location.\n\nThanks,\n\nMike",0
I got my haircut by Tamara a couple of weeks ago. We had great conversation and she gave me lots of tips on how to grow out my hair. I'll keep coming back to show her my progress!,0
"Great Mexican food and excellent service! The food and the Margaritas are to die for! Try it, it is worth it.\nEver, Erin and Paulina always make you feel welcome.",0
"Wendy's has gone waaaay down hill.  Ever sunce they changed the menu to sweet pickles, frys and red onions its hard to enjoy a meal here.\nWendys change the menu back!!!!!",0
The potsticker were delicious. The green chile stew was a bit too spicy for my taste. Service was attentive.,0
"Had a very pleasant lunch here on a Sunday. Not busy, service fine, food fine. Nice setting. Great for a nice relaxed time.",0
Love the atmosphere here and the fire pits. The food is decent too.,0
"We come here for pies and they do not disappoint. Have had lunch here once or twice, and it is OK, but it is the pies that make the trip. I recommend the mixed berry or the coconut cream.",0
"Their bread is always dry, and their sandwiches never seem as fresh as they really should be. Other locations do much better than this one, it's a shame really.",0
I love their bean & vegetable soup as well as the broccoli & cheese soup! :),0
I shop here all the time. The folks who work here are very knowledgeable and helpful. I've spent thousands of $$$$ over the years and never gotten advice or less than stellar service.,0
Friendly staff.\nFast check-out. \nGreat selection.,0
The food was extremely decent for the price.   We ordered numerous dishes and everyone seemed to enjoy them.,0
So disappointed in the fact that their prices went up ; AND they took their chips away from the meals!!! 9 dollars for a turkey wrap plus no more chips! Two thumbs down.,0
$6.50 for a 6 oz glass of 'house wine'??? $9 for a 9 oz glass & $15 for a pasta dish?  No thanks..,0
Consistently great food at a fair price.  I suggest the French Dip - a new addition to the already great menu.,0
Who is flagging down all the one-star reviews for The Harmony Bar? To anyone considering patronizing this establishment: read the flagged reviews.,0
I know a lot of people like this but It just seems like regular Mexican food to me.  I have tried several things and nothing has been anything but okay.,0
Food is good but not the waitresses.  Phyco waitress won't refill your coffee.  Weekend waitresses are to busy gabbing about their personal life's.     Service not good,0
Good hole in the wall taco joint. Handy for a quick stop on the way home from work.  Super friendly employees.,0
"Good bartenders, good people, good times.  EBs is where its at.",0
Elephant day at the zoo yesterday was amazing!!! good day at the zoo. Highly recommended specially now that we are getting a good weather to spend the day outside,0
"The salsa was okay. The fajitas, nothing to write home about. Overall, for a place that always has a long line....the food was not very good.",0
I have been eating Bob's Deli for over 10 years!  Nothing beats it!,0
Great environments! Only downside is service is a bit slow!,0
"Very, very slow service. Inadequate staffing for the volume of customers and nobody seems in a hurry to help. Find another rental car service at Charlotte airport.",0
Worst Wendy's I've been too. Food always seems like it's been sitting awhile. Bummer since it's location is near work.,0
"Excellent Restaurant.  Clean, Good Food and Service I highly recommend.",0
"Second best staff in Las Vegas.  Anything here is good, just dont try the beerlao, they are mine!",0
"Good place for traditional Chinese dim sum. The decor could use an update but they make good food. Take advantage of their $2.49 any dim sum dish, Monday - Friday.",0
I LOVE this place! THe staff is always friendly and the service is fast and the food is great!,0
this place was great. but they are now closed.,0
Not very many varieties of cupcakes available but the red velvet was very moist,0
Not bad. I've had better pho and mi kho in MN.,0
"My fault for not yelping this place before I ate here. THE FOOD IS TERRIBLE. if u go here -  have a drink and go somewhere else for dinner.  Service is excellent, food sucks!",0
"Two stars for the sandwiches, negative three stars for them never answering their phone.",0
"Vartan what can you say about him that hasn't been said. A true gentleman, a humble man, a generous man... hospitality is A++++ at Ambassador. Make time to burn",0
"Average Mexican food, chips and salsa. Fast on lunch menu service. Chicken Chimichanga was decent, added red sauce.",0
one of the worst steak sandwiches i've ever eaten. there were 7 of us and the only people who liked their food were the kids and the one who had the pizza. \n\ni would never eat here again,0
I thought that the kitchen was very clean. The food was good and fresh!!,0
"The sushi here is delicious, there are many different selections and they're all SO GOOD!! the only thing that sucks baaaad is the service.",0
Hotel was nice but nothing more then a 3 star. Room smelled musty and was dated. Staff was not all that friendly. Not what I expected when I booked the hotel. I will not be booking here again.,0
Well it's over when they want it to be underwear night 11-to whenever they feel it's over,0
"Wonderful fresh food!  I've never had a bad dish here, and just enjoyed the vermicelli with shrimp and the crispy spring roll....so delicious!  The staff is very friendly.  I'll be back soon!",0
They must have heard me!  They recovered the booths!,0
I've never had a meal here that didn't result in diarrhea afterward. Nothing more needs to be said.,0
I really don't like this place.  I had a burger with way too much fancy stuff.  I think I had an onion focacia bun and it just sucked.  Overpriced and not good.,0
excellent and quick service. Great hummus plate,0
My family LOVED this place! The falafel pita and plate were amazing. Quick service and delicious food. We will definitely be coming back here!,0
"Yeah yeah, this place is pricey, but they have a wide selection of cakes and pies! and they're mouthwatering and so gooooooooodddddd!\nCome here if you wanna have some good cakes!",0
"Great atmosphere on the patio. The food was also amazing. A relaxing end to a long day with a good drink selection and good, upscale food.",0
Walked out after waiting for over 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge we were seated.    The manager walked by twice and did not bother to stop.,0
"Excellent, fresh, amazing food every time!  Cozy hole-in-the wall deli and restaurant, served by friendly people who all speak to each other in Italian.",0
"I've ordered here for take out a couple times and it's not bad.  It's average, relatively inexpensive  Americanized semi greasy Chinese food.  I'd give them another star if they delivered!",0
"Okay, how bizarre to review a Starbucks, but the State Street Starbucks employees are seriously amenable to complicated drink requests, as well as consistently efficient and pleasant, and I thoroughly appreciate this.",0
"Overcooked rice, cold chicken. Do not recommend. When i approached cook would only microwave which in turn, dried out rest of food. Caveat emptor.",0
"Some of the highest quality and best Chinese food you'll find in the area, but with a price tag. This is a place to head to celebrate, not to consistently order out.",0
The food itself is ok. The dessert is to die for and the atmosphere is awesome. A favorite place to have.dessert and wine at the end of the night,0
This place is OK. The portions are tiny for the price and it's more Americanized than the other restaurants in town.,0
"I love the bagels here. They are tasty and always taste fresh. I would eat here for breakfast every weekend if I could! \n\nHowever, some locations are better than others- they are not always consistent.",0
"Sorry reviewers this restaurant is no match for Lotus of Siam. Everything fine at Komal-great service, cleanliness, good food but no match for Lotus of Siam. So disappointed after reading what the Wall Street Journal had to say.",0
"Great food, good service, I like the poke sashimi most!!",0
"They may not be the cheapest, but they treat me and all of my animals very well.",0
"Horrible drinks.\nTasted like tap water with a little syrup inside. Worker making the drinks gave no smile; however, cashier was friendly and helpful when they made one of our drinks wrong.",0
A nice little Asian store that has a bunch of Asian stuff for those wanting to have some Asian flavor in their life. I was able to find the green tea that I was craving here.,0
"Affordable, clean, food is delicious. Recommended!",0
"Great Service, Great Food.  Was in a hurry and they got us in/out of there quick and the food was fantastic.\n\nWill go again when I'm in the area!  Hidden Gem!",0
"this is my favorite bar ever. cheap, quiet, good local live bands, a view of doofus' falling on an ice rink, and a nice patio with token alley cat. fav-o-rite.",0
"I listen to this station throughout the day, but transplanting from Sacramento in Vegas it was nice to be able to listen to Mark and Mercedes. I think they are hilarious and it is not the normal morning talk show that just babbles...",0
"Great place for Happy Hour, good selection on wine and beer.  The staff is also very friendly.  Defintely will be going back here often.",0
The bagels are good. The sandwiches leave something to be desired in the taste department and the coffee is over roasted. Everything is a bit over-priced for what you get. I have never had a problem with the customer service.,0
"Great food, fast service and the price is right. Perfect stop for a quick lunch in the downtown area.",0
"This is probably my favorite bar in Pittsburgh.  The pizza is solid, the hot dogs are great, and the beer cave...mmmm.  My only complaint is that they haven't opened another one on the other side of town!",0
"Grew up w/El Charro, USE to be great, now it's just 'go there if someother place is closed'! Dark and family orientated but I want good food, and you don't get it here.",0
"Coffee is good, atomshere is nice, can get  a little noisy, the back room is good for small meetings.",0
"The coffee was good, the place was clean and the staff was friendly. I really like it, and would like to go back when I'm in Phoenix. \n\nUnfortunately it's TOO EXPENSIVE.",0
I want to delete my review but I  can't. Please delete,0
"This is not pizza. This is bread with sauce on top. Just go to the supermarket, get some bread and tomato sauce and slather it on - done. Gross, don't do it. Get Ian's instead.",0
"The carnitas tasted like pulled pork, very scrumptious, deserts included bananas foster, cakes galore, and clam chowder was nice. It's all good when your on a budget.",0
They have a good happy hour. Quesadilla flavor was good but tortilla needed to be crispier.,0
"I give it five stars for the service alone. Seriously, the best service I've received at a restaurant in a very long time. The salsa and bean dip is fantastic and our food was very good.",0
"The food was bland and the ciabatta bread was too hard to eat, but the employees were very pleasant.",0
Great pizza on the west size with an awesome medium buffalo wings sauce for the side \nYummy,0
"The food was really good, including the salad bar. Our server was very friendly and attentive. The portions were very generous. Bathrooms were a little dirty, but we just followed the dinner rush. Very satisfied with this meal.",0
Excellent food.  Horrible front-end service.,0
Awesome service :)! Got a pedi and they took such good care of my feet :)! Staff is super friendly! Def recommend this place! Will be back!,0
"I ordered the Machaca con Huevos; Superb! However, the service was super slow though. Because the food is so good and authentic, I give them a pass.",0
"It was a pass through. When I stopped by, it was pretty crowded and there was a dearth of outlets",0
Director is rude. Setup is weird. Teachers don't care.,0
Reading a couple bad reviews while waiting at sky harbor and had to write a review. I don't think I ever had a bad experience here. It's always clean and the airport staff is always friendly.,0
"Forgettable food, drink, and atmosphere.  Friendly service though and easily accommodates midsized to larger parties which suited our needs.",0
Awesome. Best chicken wings in town. Crispy on the outside juicy on the inside :),0
Greyhound sucks. Terrible. Went on a trip to atlantic city and back home. Not one leg of the trip did the bus leave on time. Just terrible.,0
I have had very poor experiences dealing with this business.  Period.,0
"This is the worst ph\u00f5 I have ever eaten,don't know if this is a particular busy day before the new year but the broth is tasteless,the meat portion is reasonable but overall deserve a one star.",0
3 for $5 Bud Lights or 3 for $6 Coronas. Nuff said. On the strip. Cheapest beers around. It may have been quite the walk from my hotel but so worth it!,0
Good steak good service just what you expect when you come here,0
"4  star service, food, drinks. They even gave a complimentary dessert to commemorate our engagement. Highly recommend this place to others.",0
I loved Mike and Tony's... But since they got taken over under new management a few years back I can taste the  difference and I don't like it at all...,0
"Very good soup for starters, place is packed so I can expect everything else to be good to.",0
"Was stoked to try this pizza because it seems to have several good reviews.  However, the sausage and mushroom thin crust I had was mediocre at best.  Very bland, not much flavor.",0
Can't beat the price.  Very clean.  Great size rooms.  A very nice breakfast spread!  Pool is small but almost always empty.  Even a small gym on site!  Great deal and would definitely stay again.,0
"The fish is above average, not great. The hush puppies however are amazing. They have a nice selection of sauces to choose from and premium beers are only $3.25!",0
"Went to this store yesterday, only to find it closed and empty! No longer at Chandler mall.",0
"Great food, fresh and flavorful!  For a chain restaurant its a favorite.",0
Service wasn't that great. The prime rib has no flavor. The portions were smaller than you would get at a French restaurant. Dessert looked decent but it looked better than it tastes.,0
The dry rub ribs and homemade macaroni and cheese was very good. Penny our server was very attentive to our table and service was great!,0
"As always, you can expect the huge menu at the Cheesecake Factory.\n\nAnd, as always, the food is consistently good. Not great, but good.",0
Went there with three kids. The service was excellent. The ice cream was great and the kids had fun choosing from the many delicious flavors and treats.,0
"my falafel was ok, but my brother kabob was really good. great location. reasonable price",0
"It is very expensive and the front office staff are quite snobby.  I love Dr. Meier though, the only reason I would ever go there!",0
"Horrible service. Asked 3 times to order, asked twice for a knife and what kind of Vietnamese restaurant doesn't have meatballs for your pho?",0
I love this place the lava taco is amazing and the carmel empenadas are a good treat.,0
"Excellent pizza! And the gluten free pizza is phenomenal!! Love the wings, the zucchini and the antipasto salads! Local and independently owned makes it even easier for Grande to be my favorite pizza place!",0
"Good food but takes too long before game to get order, be sure to come early, 35 mins to get food.",0
"Excellent food, excellent price. Especially for lunch!",0
This airport is really nice. That is all O_O,0
"I wholeheartedly agree with the 2 reviews before me, the staff here are insanely helpful, nice, and warm. I am in and out within 30 minutes for a regular dental appointment. Also they have a refrigerator full of free drinks!",0
The Salvation Army discriminates against people who aren't like them.  Did you know they spent $10 million dollars to try and prevent their organization from having to following anti-discrimination laws in hiring?,0
"The best cake, cupcakes and cookies in town. Will use for all future events. Thank you Barbs!",0
"We got married April 2014, and our experience was wonderful. Our relatives were amazed at the wonderful Job that was done. Thanks again for making our day so special and memorable!",0
Hands down the most delicious bagels ever. Closest to New York style bagels ever. A++++ for sure.,0
Exactly the same as the Tempe location but you can swap the annoying students for pricks from north Scottsdale.  The food and beer remain tasty.,0
Good but probably the most expensive Italian Restaurant I've ever been to. The food is good. But not worth the price. We have cheaper and better options like Olive Garden.,0
I love this place.  The vermicelli is amazing.  It is a cozy hole in the wall.  The food is so good.  And it's BYOB.,0
Today was the second day in a row that this store didnt have crispy fried chicken or crispy chicken strips.,0
Greasy unappetizing fried food. Low quality ingredients. Pretty much tastes all the same.\n\nNever again.,0
"Mediocre food, average atmosphere...it did not live up to the billing it had been given by a friend.",0
"OK, Starbucks is Starbucks and this location like most has its share of regulars and comfortable atmosphere.",0
"The atmosphere is awesome, perfect for a luncheon with friends. The iced coffee is good and so are their sandwiches.",0
"Great diner food!\nWent for breakfast and had chicken fried steak with eggs over easy,\nWOW it was friggin awesome.Good service too.",0
"For a quick bite to eat this is the place, it is inexpensive and filling. The staff is always super nice, and food is always good. Cant go wrong just wish they would open one in Surprise.",0
"I always come here when we they have crawfish in season. But all of their other dishes are great too. Tonight the service was a little off, but all in all dinner was still great as always.",0
Great local yarn store with lots of high-quality yarns of many different varieties.  The cafe in back is nice and cozy too.,0
"Delivery took 2 hr, and I live just few block away from a store. Pizza was cold and pretty much waist of money.",0
"Best pizza and Italian food in Oakland PERIOD!!!! Nice family owned establishment. Great food, great prices.",0
Food was great. They've got a great menu to choose from....Also the service was excellent. I've been here many times and it's consistently been a great place to dine.,0
The donuts are at a whole new level (in the vacinity off heaven) than your regular donut shops. I had no idea donuts could be this good. Go early to get the best.,0
"Really disliked my meal.  Considering the bar was set pretty high by an amazing Mexican restaurant I went to in Chicago (who's name escapes me!!), I was really disappointed.  No need to visit again.",0
Relatively small airport with a regional feel. Kind of limited on food options but not too bad. Taxi line can be brutal in the summer heat so keep that in mind...,0
Average Italian menu items and good service in a nice setting.  Try the steaks they are very good for the price.  Staff is also very good with children.,0
"They work quickly, but speed isn't worth it if the final product is damaged.",0
"Best dive bar ever!!!  Cash only, no windows...  Go here when all else fails or at the end of a long drinking sesh.",0

the chicken wings gave me food poisoning.  will avoid in the future.,0
hmmm the guy that work up front hates his life but the club pretty fun if you have nothing better to do,0
Large portions. Great bread sticks. Chicken parmesan was top quality.,0
Went here and they were rude and charged different prices then on the menu and they told us it was because we ordered something off menu but we asked for what was on there. be aware dining here.,0
"Fast, friendly service. Breakfast was very good. My husband had ham and eggs. It was perfectly prepared, and the slice of ham was as large as a dinner plate. We will definitely go back when in the area.",0
"We always go for the family night special. 5lbs wings,  large salad and large pizza. Service is spotty as you can have more than 1 person waiting on you.  They just added all new and more big screen tvs.",0
A small treasure of Charlotte. Convenience store with a small bar with cool clientele and a great beer selection. Good stuff.,0
They make the best sourdough baguette ever! Yum! Anything I have ever gotten from them is delicious!,0
Place just opened for the day and the restrooms by the food court are already disgusting and the housekeepers are just standing in the food court texting and looking stuff up on their phones while talking to each other.,0
"Disappointing. They spend all their money on the major travelling exhibits (Body Worlds, Narnia), so the rest of the exhibits look a little old and uninspired.",0
"Fantastic food, especially the fresh lobster with scallions and ginger. Very friendly staff and owners. Go there weekly.",0
"This is the best in Madison:  great staff, great coffee and tea, great food. A welcome indie alternative to Starbucks and other chains. The owner is a hands-on manager and it shows in all the details.",0
"Great variety of food but mediocre. Taste less meet - the Mongolian beef, i didnt like the Cold See Food, steam rice is good. Sushi ok, Mongolian Grill good. 2 persons $26.",0
The attendants are nice when available. The playlist overhead made me want to leave. It is a horrible mix of country and pop.,0
"This place is Good Mexican food!  Love the Taco Salad. My husband had the Chili Relleno, Enchilada, rice and beans. It was REALLY good too!!!  Yummy  Yummy Yummy",0
It was the blandest fried rice I'd ever eaten...and it cost me ten bucks.,0
Just finished a dinner of pierogies that our Pgh family brought to WV - always look forward to Pierogies Plus - try the apricot for a sweet treet!,0

"The wine was okay, food was decent, but the service was blah! The waiter treated us like we didn't belong. I've in place more upscale than this and didn't receive such poor treatment.",0
I consider myself an expert in green chili chimis and La Canasta has a pretty good one. One the down side- they don't know how to give back correct change.,0
"There's only one good sandwich here, and it's the Bobbie. Capriotti's is overpriced and I suggest that you look elsewhere for  decent sandwich.",0
"My favorite Thai place in Arizona by far! My go to spot for dates, business meetings, and just because it's Wednesday.",0
"One of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to in Phoenix.  Everything I've ever had here was good, except the guacamole.  The guac is bland and uninspiring.",0

"Good cheap Chinese food. Close to home, so it's a winner with me. Always friendly, pretty consistent quality.",0

ALWAYS delicious! Oktoberfest is insane every year.,0
My sandwich was tasty. It was ready soon after I ordered it. Pretty good. I'd go again.,0
DIVE BAR! \nI do not get the fascination for DIVE Bars,0
"Excellent place, super friendly staff. It's under construction.. remodeling it but still much better selection than \""neighborhood Wal-Mart\"" for healthier organic foods.",0
"It's a Macaroni Grill... not much to say about this... if you have gone to one, you have seen them all. Nothing is really memorable. Including the service. Prices are reasonable.",0
I had some issues develop with my dogs stitches after the surgery. The vet was very responsive and asked me to come in right away. I feel like they really care. No charge for the visit either.,0
On Friday evening at about 7 pm we had to wait 30 min for a table (for four) and than another 25 min for pizza. The thin crust pizza was delicious but no reservations accepted (need to wait to be seated).,0

Dr costa is amazing but she left. We will follow her anywhere and know of many others who feel the same,0
The food there was okay. I had a salmon dish there. I don't eat beef so I can speak for their steak.,0
"Very Basic Sabdwich, but good.  Good value also. Weird area, but good.",0
They've got the best ranch dressing I've found so far in Arizona. They've got burgers they got pot roast they've got old style cooking anything you want it is a great place to go.,0
Great locally owned cafe with quality coffee! Cozy atmosphere and a few outdoor tables to enjoy some nice Carolina weather.,0
The restaurant is beautiful and the service is just OK.  The food is nothing special and I don't see any reason to choose this restaurant again.,0
"This salon is a great cheap alternative in the central phoenix area.  I had a totally decent haircut for $30, the service was really nice.  Nothing out of this world, but definitely a great option if you are saving money.",0
"I must say with respect for the Thai culture, this resturaunt did slightly impress me with one of their chicken curry dishes, service was pleasant, and I do believe I shall return.",0

Fair but not a four star salsa lacks a Mexican flare and the bean dip doesn't have much taste tortilla soup was fair ceasar salad okay dressing little thin,0
"Nice ambiance but a little noisy, over priced.",0
Wow not impressed wit the mens clothing prices. There a whole bunch of higher end store with this price range. The store crew was amazing and helpful! Really nice people.,0
Great place to watch a game. Friendly staff went out of their way to get my game on even though the Steelers were on at the same time.,0

"Unique location and good food, the flags remind me at my original home (Bavaria), can recommend the pizza and the carrot cake :)",0
My puppy chewed my glass frames and the staff were able to fix them for me in minutes.  It was a welcome surprise.  I highly recommend.,0
Try it if u want good Sichuan food. It's above average for food. Four star for the environment. Service is fine.,0
One of Charlotte's best DIners. I've lived in NY and Chicago and have been to many and this compares. Brings back memories every time I dine here.,0

"Gary is great with coloring (blonde). It's a cool, laid back little salon.",0
"Great food, nice people and mediocre service. I enjoy this place often!",0

"My first time in Vegas and this was a great place to finish up my trip. Great selection, people, and price. Best hidden gem in Vegas.",0

Stopped in for a pint.  Had some pizza (was OK) and hit another place.,0
"Service was mediocre. The food didn't taste like it was anything to die for. The bacon pancakes were a nice addition, however, I would still choose MiMi's cafe or even Denny's over this breakfast venue.",0
Will be back here every two weeks. Great pizza. Great options. Couldn't ask for better!,0
I have had lots of items off of their large menu and everything has been good.,0
"This airport has a part that was recently redone and that section is beautiful. The older part of the airport is, well, old. And it's noticeable. Lousy restaurants and not much else that's exciting.",0
Decent Mexican food.  Easy split checks.  Good for larger lunch groups.,0
Lots of food and grease. Enuff said.,0
We really enjoy coming here. Our waitress Poom is so cordial and attentive with us!!\n\nThank you!!,0
Great homemade noodles. Below average thai green curry. Average tofu. No air conditioning even on 80+ degree humid day.,0
Katz Deli is indeed closed -- but the space will become a second Postino location.,0
"\""Food and ambience was great, but staff completely misinformed us about the price of the buffet; it was Way pricier than i thought...bad service\""",0
The food is very tasty. The restaurant is clean. The beer is priced very well and includes local brews.\nThe radio station IS THE BEST!!!!\nIts good for groups in a semi private room with a scary clown ride!,0
Used to be a regular at this bar.  They fired Dawn the bartender who was the best worker this bar had.  Will return when she is rehired.,0
"Food may be decent, but when mixed with horrible service and CASH ONLY, I think not.",0
My food was surprisingly good but the tuna salad had some odd ingredients. Read my full review!,0

Best sushi in the valley!! Been going here for at least 10 years :),0
Good for a fast lunch. Had the gyro and added feta. Gyro was fine. Bottle of coke had icy slush in it.,0
I ordered the center-cut ribeye for entree. It was delicious. \nThe environment is nice and servers are polite. Recommended.,0
Not so good. Got very sick after eating the mahi mahi and macaroni salad.,0
"A completely brilliant store with literally...everything medical... you might ever need or ever imagine you might need (and dear lord, I hope not), but most importantly, a knowledgeable, helpful owner and staff who genuinely seem to care...",0
It's an airport.  It is not near the top of my favorites.,0
"Went here for lunch today and the Reuben was delicious.  The sweet potato fries were not, soggy with grease.  Service was pleasant and the jazz music was soothing.",0
Really hard to find a good cup of coffee in the states... I'd say this is the best  cappuccino I've had since Italy.,0
"Worst service I ever had! Served us water didn't care to ask if we wanted anything else to drink. As we ordered our food, they were mean. Never again will I go there!",0
Confusing airport.   Seriously confusing out of a lot of airports that I've been to.,0

I will recommend this to anyone who wants a familiar taste and a break from big portioned Las Vegas food and buffet...,0
"I love El Zocalo! I wish this restaurant was a little bit closer to us, because we would visit more!",0
This place is adorable!  You can order coffees to go and take out orders or you can eat there.,0
Great mall with plenty of stores and a decent food court.,0
"Always good, this time had a sea dog, a foot long piece of fried fish in a roll. Really good white fish, probably cod.",0
Great fish house.  Loved it when I could eat fried food.  Better than most seafood houses at the Beach.,0
"These bagels are fine, but I think their drinks are yummy. I like the blackberry lemonade. \n\nThe interior is sterile, but air conditioned with clean bathrooms and on state street that is saying a lot.",0
Nice Staff. Always a good night at Harolds.,0
I really wasn't impressed with my sandwich. They don't put enough meat on it.  The taste was ok but I mainly tasted bread.  For the price of the sandwich I'm better off going to subway.,0
Haven't been in for years but the home made sausages were killer!,0
They have the absolute WORSE customer service. So sad. No wonder I goto Nordstroms. Dillards even treated me nice. Time for Macy's to take notes...tisk tisk tisk.,0
"The service was very friendly, but the food wasn't all that good. Most everything tasted like it had been sitting around for quite a while before being plated. Especially the potatoes. Not sure I would return.",0
"This place is the worst, the service was horrible and there was a hair in my food. DO NOT GO HERE PASS!",0
It's an airport......\n\nThe taxi guys were nice though.,0
"Front desk ladies are very rude and the gentleman that is always there is very strange.  I live up the street and it was convenient to take my child there, but next time, I will go somewhere else.  RUDE STAFF!",0
"The food was just so so. The ribs were tough, the chicken was a little dry. Maybe I just caught them on a bad day. I may gp try them again, but probably not for a while.",0
This place is horrible! They said if you want real eggs you have to ask them. Very confusing why the name is the good egg if they do not even serve real eggs.,0
Totally delicious pho in a very informal atmosphere. The combination spring roll was very good. Prices are excellent! I would go back!,0
I have gone to Gino's for years. He does a great cut. It's an old fashion barbershop including men's magazines.,0
"Excellent service, very fair price.  No nonsense approach and nice people!",0
Closing down for several months to add a kfc to a taco bell that is doing a perfectly fine business and then revising your hours so that you are not open as late doesn't impress me.,0
Great Staff!\nGood Care.\nDirty facility and slow attention.,0
"Their ice cream machine seems like it's always down, don't go there if you are expecting a hot filet-o-fish sandwich.",0
Closed last week. Heard they are moving inJanuary to Hayden and Via de Ventura in Scottsdale.,0
I was looking for a great steakhouse in Charlotte! I know longer have to look any further. Between the delicious anniversary steak dinner and the best wait staff; Morton's is my favorite place.,0
"This was a great little find! The staff were lovely and the menu is expansive, but full of great options. Our food was delicious and the portions were perfect for the price.",0
"For a crappy airline, they're pretty convenient and organized with the way you can check-in, board the plane, and getting your beverage. The stewardesses are very chill and silly.",0
A lovely place for an outdoor lunch.  Good food and very pleasant setting on a golf course.,0
Decent fare. Spicy level was disappointing.,0
good service.  food was ok.  soup was not good.  souffle was GREAT!  also had the ravioli w/ox tail (eh) and foie gras risotto was ok.,0
Great stop for those taking the light rail on their way to an event downtown!,0
"Took my Daddy here to get his beard trimmed and while they did a fairly decent job of the cut, Victoria needs to learn a little customer service (and how to even out a mustache properly!)",0
The service was very slow. Blooming onion was overcooked to the point of tasting burnt. The quesadilla was dripping grease.  On a positive note. It was not crowded by any stretch so our conversations were easily heard.,0
Customer service was horrible. They lost a $700 sale because the Guy behind the counter was a dick.,0
I fly out of here mostly on business but I've spent 20 mins in security and 2 hours so its always a crap shoot.  Pun intended.,0
"We're tourists & this was a great find. The service was excellent, the atmosphere fun, and Mexican food the way we like it--lots of choices & the right amount of spice. We'll be back.",0
The lobster tail was salty. The crab legs were alright. The shrimp was awesome. The asparagus was amazing. All in all it was eh.,0
Delish!!! Their sticky buns are really good and they have a yummy assortment of baked goods.,0
They have a nice beer selection in the bar and cute waitresses.,0
I ordered the Margherita pizza. it was just ok I have never had one made like I have tasted in New York with fresh balls of mozzarella fresh bail and tomato's. I still will order but maybe ill try something different.,0
"A great place to find deals on good clothes. This location is not as organized - or clean - as some others, but it is decent and has awesome deals. I have no issues shopping here.",0
"This place is awesome! Best nail salon I have experienced in a long time. Great prices, great polish selection, and I even got a shoulder massage while my nails were drying. I'll be back!",0
Great food for the price.  I enjoyed their vegetarian options especially the pad Thai. Love the inside. Great service as well.,0
This place is horrible. The service is second rate and the estimates are through the roof. A poorly run company by poorly organized people,0
"Smaller than the Chandler location, but definitely a great place to find bargains. Come here prepared to do a bit of digging (especially in the shoe section) and expect to wait in line.",0
"The ruebans are decent, but not worth the 12.50 they charge.  Service is great though.",0
"My husband Michael loves it here....  Not only because it's literally around the corner from our home, but because the staff, course and restaurant are awesome.  Always has been great experience!!!",0
"Been coming to Four Peaks now for a few years and I have always had excellent service, Awesome food, and the beer is about some of the best microbrew in the state! definitely give the Hop Knot a try!",0
"I was there to see Dixie Swim Club, The play was fun the actors were very good.  The food was horrible!!",0
"I was contacted by the owner of the salon. He was extremely gracious and apologetic for the bad experience, and offered to try and make it right. Which goes a long for making things better for me.",0
Excellent atmosphere and friendly service.   Food was great.,0
Great dive bar option in old town. The drinks are pretty cheap and they always have specials. A lot of people start their nights here. One thing I dislike is the grimy bathrooms.,0
Went in for a fax and it was simple and quick. Have to have a card tho for the machine. I got some help because it was my first time. Nice,0
Kids eat free on Mondays between 4:30 to close.  Food is great.  Kids meals are awesome and healthy.  Love this place!!!,0
Overpriced and uneven haircuts given. Don't waste your money here! It costs more to get a tiny dog groomed than a regular woman's haircut. $55 for a 3 pound dog!! They are crazy...,0
"Beautiful ambiance, fantastic service, delicious food, and a personal toast from the owner was a great touch!",0
The sever forgot about us and my katsu curry tasted like meat gravy. What a waste of my precious hard earned money.,0
I just tried the Jersey Mike's in Salisbury and it makes these guys look like pikers. They should take a drive up there and see how they really should be doing things.,0
These guys are awesome.  The store at this location was able to balance my tires quickly after another store tried three times only to tell me it was as good as it was going to get.  Thanks Ray.....,0
"Just got a small, pre-made chicken salad sandwich and a cup of chicken chili from the Fifth Avenue store, and paid over $9. You can get much better quality and value elsewhere in Pittsburgh.",0
"Not too impressed, there are much better Mexican restaurants around.  The tacos however are pretty good.  The salsa is pretty bad.   Also can't shake the whole health department-forced shutdown a few years back.",0
Always a wait... But ppl are nice.,0
Amazing food.\nBig Portions\nGreat service,0
"They were supposed to design and  build our booth, a big one. TWO weeks before the event they said they could not work on it and did not have anything ready. I would not recommend working with them.",0

Not really the warmest service but always prompt and delicious.,0

"Best Chinese in town. Quick delivery, great service, great price.",0
"Wow I think that having a broken collarbone is better than dealing with the office staff here.  Medical staff review to follow.  Expert advice,  avoid this place at all costs.",0
"I crave the Jackie O cake, a must have!!!!",0
"This place is hit or miss for me.  Good location, great looking women working there but food is never outstanding.  But if you want to have fun and be seen then this a place to go.",0
Great breakfast spot. Tons of lovely options. Everything is big portions. I love the green eggs and ham as well as the mile high omelette.,0
"Newest update The owner here is charging.60 for a stinking refill that costs him 2 to 3 cents. I don't know what this guy is thinking. Greed, Greed, Greed!!!!!",0
Yea to expencsive and the staff believes that they are so busy customer service is out the window.,0
"The food was decent.  But yet again, the staff managed to screw my order up and ended up charging me more then what I should of payed for.",0
Ordered for delivery and after an hour and a half without my food I drove down and was told they had not even started my order. NEVER GO TO THIS RESTAURANT.,0
"Meh...I love their drinks but I never go there hungry. Every time I hope the food is good and try something new and everytime I'm disappointed, its always really soggy and greasy...bleck!",0
Wow!  Dirty room.  Not vucuumed.  Extremely indifferent service.  Room smelled moldy.  Never again!,0
Looks like if you write a neg-- review it gets filtered.Sorry Yelp but it is what it is.,0
Best healthy mexican food around. I crave it.,0
"This has been the worst dinner I had at this place I know I came for the special, but we order a well done steak and it came out in like  3  minutes super dry and over cooked and service was not good at all",0
"I had pancakes, eggs over easy and ham. The eggs and pancakes were great, I would pass on the ham. Not enough servers.",0
Delicious Vietnamese cuisine! Their pho soup is very tasty and flavorful! I only eat at this restaurant for pho and bun bo hue!,0
"Strong beers and big burgers.  Love \""The Bratzel\""  a burger topped with a brat.  Be sure to try it with the pretzel bun!",0
"Just fair, but you learn to appreciate decent chinese food for its rarity (I know, a strange concept for those of us living in the Bay Area).",0
Always amazing. Every location is good. I love the chicken shwarma pita! This location is my favorite. First one I ever went to and consistantly awesome!,0
"Good, not great.  I'm sure there must be better places in AZ.",0
Food was good. Service was TERRIBLE from the hostess to the servers to the manager.....BAD. The Price of the food does not leave room for bad service. Take your money elsewhere!,0
Worth a stop but not a return.  2 1/2 stars.,0
"What more can I say except it is over priced, greasy Mexican food! I have had better in Texas, the only thing that saved them from being a one star is their great salsa!",0
"overpriced and grocery carts are in the parking lot if you need one. I prefer a Sprouts, Safeway, or Frys.",0
"I don't recommend this place, rude doctor, unprofessional, I'm so mad I couldn't wait longer to give my feedback about the doctor. Pay 30$ to be treated like sh****",0
I was hungry and I stopped in for a quick bite. I ordered two supreme crossiants and a courtesy cup of water. and they were very good and the service was quick and friendly.,0
"QTs are usually pretty clean,fast etc but this one is the most ghetto QT I've ever seen. It is in the Tolleson area so par for the course I suppose.",0
We really like the pizza.  We brought my father for dinner and he said this was the best pizza he'd ever had: my father is 96-years-old.  That says it all :-),0
"Once again Yelp..Update!!!! This location is not a current Weinerschnitzel, it's a Loan Mart.",0
Do you like greasy overcooked American chinese? If not try some place else! They cater to those with no appreciation for anything close to decent chinese take out.,0
Fantastic food.  Decent service.  The location leaves something to be desired.,0
"Just like another shoe place I reviewed, it's a hit or miss. This time it was a big miss. I found absolutely nothing.  Yuck",0
"One of the better Chinese food restaurants in Pittsburgh. The food is pretty authentic, and while they have your standard American Chinese food, they have some genuine-tasting Cantonese dishes too.",0
Drive through takes forever in the morning 20 minutes for one burrito. Egg Shells in my Carne Asada Burroito after I waited forever  :(,0
The new wing seems like it should be designed better from a Transportation Engineering and Logical point of View. makes me wonder if they had a lack of space to work with.,0
"The food is great, and when they say \""hot,\"" they genuinely mean it. The maximum star rating made me cry into my food. This has never happened in any other Madison restaurant.",0
"Worst service ever.no silverware, no napkins and no straws....food took forever and the appetizer never showed up.",0
Extremely loud inside the bar. The bartenders are ignorant to drinks other than what's on tap or the old standby well drinks. They are rude and lifeless.,0
Very disappointed tonight. Ordered a special pizza that wasn't on the pizza bar and it was never delivered. Manager was too busy texting on his cell phone to once walk around the restaurant. Poor service.,0
"Boy, their attitudes sure do suck, and their subs are so unbelievably nasty.  Uuuggghhh!",0
"This place is the best Mediterranean food in town. Love it. When I'm not there I can't stop thinking about it. Gotta get the chicken shwarma plate, I promise you will not be sorry.",0
Go here. Eat one of each of the macarons. Ignore the price. Change your life!!!,0
"By mistake I thought I could get the same service and quality of work from another Sprint store (in the mall) and surprise, surprise I did not and back to see Danny and Sami went....they are fabulous!",0
Very expensive for a bowl of soup just over $7.00. Also the very small potato chips for the Kettle bag is $1.99. Really!!! That is way to high for 4oz of chips and mostly air.,0
"An amazing and unique botanical garden. There are a lot of botanical gardens in the us but none quite like this which showcases how beautiful, colorful and full of life the desert really is.",0
It's nice to see all the old signs. Learned more than I wanted to know about sign making. The tour guide was very informative.,0
The employees have no idea what they are doing. It took them literally 30 minutes to fax one document. And then it didn't even go through. Avoid this location at all costs.,0
Don't pass this place up. The food is good but the taro Macaron with coconut pandan Icecream sandwich is out awesome! The best $3.50 we spent.,0
I think its time America got rid of Walmarts.,0
"Phoenix Sky Harbor is really easy to get around, traffic isn't difficult to work with and with continuing updates Sky Harbor is on its way to being a world class airport.... also free wifi",0
"This is my favorite breakfast restaurant!  I have been to several other places and tried their eggs benedict, and these are the best!  Everything else always looks really good too, but I can't turn down the Benny's.",0
Good authentic mexican food in the heart of old town. The Santos building next to patio is pretty cool too.,0
Good place with reasonable prices. Had the BBQ burger which was good and the sweet potato fries were really good as well... Being in the mall this place is definitely a good alternative.,0
Horrendous customer service. I've seen the sales associates behaving very rudely to customers. And don't even think about using them for passport photos. Every attempt was rejected by the passport office.,0
"Saw The Hunger Games. The theater was a bit warm and the screen a but worn. Otherwise, it was fine.",0
Went there to get an Oil Change and was sold a transmission service. They put no oil in the car and double the transmission fluid in the vehicle. Had to get my Transmission replaces and my Engine!!!,0
Love that they make the guacamole right in front of you,0
"Iceberg lettuce!  Iceberg lettuce!  Really!?  They need to consider upgrading to finer vegetation.  And to make the sandwich worse, the tuna fish was swimming in mayonnaise.  WTF is this $hit?",0
"Really good food but service was not at all good! We waited so long, our waiter was not a people person, didn't tell us about portion sizes, and the place was pretty dirty. (Can't imagine how the kitchen looks)",0
Do you remember how Pancho's used to taste? Keep that memory and don't go again.,0
the lady that works there was not helpful at all.  Very poor customer service.,0
anything you need you can find it at the market :),0
It's like they took all the worst employees at surrounding fast food restaurants and stuck them here. They've gotten one out of 5 drive through orders right. Don't go here,0
We've been eating Cary's Pizza for years and have tried all the pizza in town. Cary's is the best! Hands down! I would have given them 5 stars if the prices were lower.,0
We found this place from a recommendation from a friend. It is a gem and we love the outdoor patio. \nGreat skinny margarita and excellent poblano enchilada\nNo overly priced and great service,0

Grade: B\n\nVery underrated place. Unique food. Excellent service. Somewhat pricey.,0

"So when i go to a breakfast house i base how good it is off their potatoes, and I've got to say The Farm House home fries are my favorite breakfast potatoes.. My new favorite place...",0
I wish I could give ZERO stars. The receptionist had an attitude. I can tell Dr. Reddy probably first hand hired her with his disgusting attitude. This was probably the worst office and costumer service I have ever encountered.,0

"This is one of my favorite local sushi joints! For a fresh and inexpensive sushi meal they can't be beat. Great service, great sushi, always fresh and really great prices. A wonderful neighborhood sushi joint.",0

My kids love the chili cheese dogs here and I like the cheesy tater tots. Seriously where else can you buy fast food tater tots covered in cheese? The afternoon happy hour for slushes is also nice on the wallet.,0
Nice and quiet hotel off the main road a lot of people miss if they not paying attention. Very clean and nice staff.,0
"Decent restaurant with plenty of fishes, seafood and chicken on menu. I dont eat pork or beef. Loved it.",0

"I do not recommend this firm.  They are extremely unprofessional, incompetent, & rude. They don't return calls.",0
Busy cozy colorful place with great Mexican food at a reasonable price. Lots of  blue collar workers have lunch here. They know good food.,0
"I love this salon. Vivian and Sally are amazing. They do a really great job and fast. They always fit me in same day. I am a perfectionist, and my nails look amazing. Eyebrows too ;)",0

"Not so fresh, taste bland and generally sea food away from the ocean is a bad idea.  This has just confirmed my belief.  Atmosphere is nice though.",0
"There is nothing terrible about this restaurant but there is nothing that good either - average food.   Given the price, it is definitely not worth it unless location is your primary concern.",0

They have Boba! that alone gives them 5 stars! Finally a good boba place in north las Vegas :),0

The late night menu at cafe fiesta is decent and priced well. Pancakes though are some of the best I have had! My 5 year old loves the buffet.,0

Tried the shrimp fried rice. I think it's safe to say I'm never going back.,0

I literally waited in the car 10 mins before the order came out in the drive thru! Did someone say fast food!?? Oh and it wasn't even for me,0

This airport is really nice! A lot shopping if you get stuck or bored. Food choices from fancy salads to BBQ. Sky Harbor is in my top 10 airports.,0
Good size margaritas with plenty of alcohol for $3.99 during happy hour!!! Doesn't get better than that...,0
I had The Garlic Pizza which was tasty. The Service was ok. Other than that I think this place is average.,0
These are best tacos in this area. Tacos el gordon are not that great.,0
"Their patio is a nice area, wait staff was nice as well. However the food was alright, not worth the slightly elevated prices and they charge for extra chips and salsa.",0
Old school greasy spoon food and very nice service. It's a throwback to another time and a good one at that.,0
The restaurant looks dirty and greasy inside.  All the side dishes looked like they had been sitting there for days.  The flavor of the food was good tho.  But the restaurant needs a makeover and a good cleaning,0
Good ribs and big portions!!!  service is always good too.,0
"Like their Terriyaki bowl and also the bulgogi, sushi is also a good choice here are well. Haven't ventured much on their other items maybe one day...",0

"Best Greek food ever!  The owners are cool, too...\n\nThe sauces are awesome.  Quality is top notch.  This is a 5 star spot!",0
Recommend the beef head and tongue. The lamb taco is really two so well worth it. Very authentic and if you are looking for real authentic Mexican tacos then this is the place!,0
Indeed one of the best Mediterranean restaurants in town! The Greek salad dressing is authentic and delish. Can't wait to go back.,0
Absolutely wonderful. Service was great. The meal was exquisite. We had a great time. Nice atmosphere and a delicious meal. I highly recommend.,0
Well the waitress was really nice and was working hard.    But she had to do the place on her own.   Food came out cold.   :(,0

I have been to this Applebee's a couple of times. Service is great. They offer military discount and they have week day lunch specials. Love it :),0

Great local place that I don't go to enough.  The food is really good and they have great specials almost everyday.,0

"As always, a great dinner.  Pulled pork appetizer is a must.  Pork tenderloin was perfection and those grits made the dish.",0
I love the Kung Pao with chicken. The Fried Rice with Chicken is excellent too. The food is excellent. Decent sized portions too. Once of my favorite places to eat.,0
"I didn't like the beans, guacamole it's ok salsa no spicy,  the patron margarita ok they need to have mojitos, y chabelas or micheladas not my thing not for me",0
I came here from another oil change place that I wasn't happy with. They were nice and honest to me. I had a very pleasant experience. And the oil change literally took 10 min. :),0

If you don't love YC's then we can't be friends.,0

You know you're in Vegas when you see slots before baggage pickup.  Was pretty clean and baggage pickup was easy.,0
Have you heard the. Story of the crooked  cleaner??,0
"This airport, unlike any other, is all about getting zero sleep before you zombie walk in to the place, to your gate, and on to your plane. Being fully rested makes the security buzzer go off and is highly not recommended.",0
"I went here for happy hour and they had a good amount of beer specials. The staff was friendly, the atmosphere was very nice. I would probably come back here agae.",0
"If you don't  mind a long wait even when they are not busy for a mediocre car wash, this is your place.  Lazy employees and no management that cares.",0
Skeptical of this place. Turned out to be okay though. Had the club melt and onion rings and they were pretty good. Onion rings were actually really good.,0
"THEY FREEZE THE TEQUILA!  margaritas a great, and they have yummy snacks.  good for happy hour.",0
"Delicious. We ordered dinner take-out, the Tikka Masala and Aloo Ghobi, both of which were fantastic. Naan delicious as well. Priced the same as all the other Indian around. Will be going back.",0
"Nice Aquarium, and nice programs. (Like feed the bears)",0
I didn't feel that good spending my money here food was ok but the customer service not that great,0
"Good sandwiches, fancy-type bread, not a large selection for the kids.  Ice cream seems okay, if not outstanding.  Reasonably quick and friendly service, more affordable than some of the other options in the area.",0
Disappointing. Overly salted entree as well as very salty side of roasted mushrooms.,0
It's pretty good.  The Raj is an amazing IPA.  The food is decent.  Kill off the student population and I would hang out here.,0
"= = = = = =  CLOSED!  = = = = = =\n\nSadly, this nice Sweet Tomatoes has closed.     :-(",0
"Horrible service by an overworked, tired looking, grouchy waitress named TRACY. \nSlow service, cold food, Just Awful!",0
This used to be my favorite Chinese restaurant near downtown now they raised their prices and are charging for bland fried rice for lunch and the soup looks like a bowl of snot! I will not be back!!,0
"Great lunch spot, really yummy sandwich and very shareable.",0
Gross my roomate brought this home one night. I would never recommend peter to anyone!\n\nIt is cheap and discusting! Parents who feed their children this should be jailed for child abuse.,0
"It isn't well known but each Manuel's is owned by one of the children of the original owner- the best one is on Peoria, that is one that you hear good things about.",0
"Very good pizza, great service, hip live music and tasty Vegan options! Family-owned is a plus! Drive the old car as parking is very tight.",0

not bad.  not great.  But it worked for me.,0
Andrea's friday night class is awesome. I am a fighter and i enjoy the stretch and push i get from her class. A great release with even better results!,0

Gross. New owners. New salad. New garlic dip (now made with mayonnaise). Sub par now.,0
"The interior looks like Boulder Station, but with a different floor plan.  I had some Mexican dude asking me for a dollar as I was leaving.  Crappy!",0
Yet another sports bar that's on campus.  Don't get the  mushroom soup here even though it sounds awesome!,0
The classic 'date' or 'romance' place on campus. Good food and always fun. The Cellar Bar is great place to get away from the craziness of State Street. Great little basement hideaway!,0
I did not try their food but I went in to get an ice tea. It was almost $3 and so old that I took half a sip and dumped it out. Nothing worse than terribly old ice tea!,0
French Fries with Mexican food LOL classic. Get the big fat chicken taco and you will be eating the best taco offered from Del Taco :) also the fries are rather good I was just messing around.,0
do not use these people to finance  your vehicle.  They do not fully disclose fees and terms and when you get to the end of your loan you will have a surprise.  Unethical,0
The fact that Bashas is still even in business both astounds and frightens me.,0
Beer good and cheap happy food portions have been downsized and quality not as good as it use to be.,0
"The grinders & custard are heavenly, but there's too many kids standing around behind he counter & the food is expensive for what you get.",0
A nice diner; better than Denny's.\nCan't go wrong.\nGood service service.,0
"We tried their sandwiches and soups, and they were very yummy. The interior is delightful and bright. \n\nDefinitely would go back!",0
seriously? concierge service and tip jars in the bathrooms? but what happens if no one tips? (shudder),0
"Been going here for 22 years.  The people are the same the food is the same, but the restaurant itself has improved over the years. It's cleaner and nicer although the decor is pretty much the same.",0

"Our I pad was stolen out of our room by a staff member! Nice place, but we are out a 400 dollar iPad!",0
Excellent food and very friendly service. Had a prime rib sandwhich that was very tasty and was a large portion. Fun atmosphere as well. I'll be in again... Soon!,0

There is no better soul food restaurant in Charlotte than La'wan's. The others are imposters! Try the whiting...outstanding!!!,0
Best Thing I have done for my business.....was working with Citrus Signs and letting them design my banner and business cards.  I strongly recommend this company for anyones advertising needs!  Money well spent!,0
"I love their tuna sandwich, my favorite. Bread smells good, the vegetables are fresh. The best is that it is super quick. Order is ready even before I finish paying",0
Had a very disappointing breakfast. The french toast actually comes with toast. Really? The French toast and bacon came out cold. This is more of a coffee place is a breakfast place.,0
"EXCELLENT and attentive services, food is fresh, the combo dinner was a bit salty to my taste",0
"Not a bad place,.i suppose. I had the turkey and dressing and it was quite tasty, but I didn't like the presentation. The spinach was a bit under cooked for my liking.",0
"I love PF Chang's,  always delicious and they added new dishes to their menu. Great pan Asian cuisine.",0
I had an amazing experience with the new veterinarian. Her name is  Pamela Boyd.She is amazing.She took care of my dog like Doctor Lieb.I recommend this veterinary to everybody who wants a vet who cares about the animals,0
eating the Devil Dog is no easy task.  Its a pound hot dog with a huge bun and its so delicious. If you finish it you get a free tee shirt.,0
Best fried chicken best everything is consistent and hot and fresh! Love the okra sweet tea kool aid candy sweets  Mac and cheese so yummy,0
"I love the atmosphere here, it's very chill. Their coffee isn't bad and the service is pretty good. Also, they are open \""late\"", so that's an added bonus if you need to make a coffee run at 11 at night",0
Lousy service.  Food was ok.  Fries were cold.  Server never asked about refills for drinks.,0
holy mother of god.\n\nthe tofu polungo is so deliciously well done. the tofu has unbelievable texture and is well-seasoned. the vegetables are properly cooked and the sauce is tasty.,0
"Food is good, the people who work there are great, it's just really, REALLY slow. I like it, just really have to make the time to wait for it.",0
This terrific cafe serves delicious food in large portions at reasonable prices with great service. The #17 vegetarian platter is a tasty way to taste a bunch of different options.,0
Tonya is super sweet and the front desk people are very helpful,0
8 bucks and change for 4 mediocre bagels and some disgusting strawberry cream cheese.. No thanks.. Not again,0
This place is ridiculous. It's like a New Mexico Disney land and the food is comparable to hospital cafeteria style mexican food. It's dreadful and just pathetic. Really just a waste of time.,0
Great food but it's way too expensive - 2 double burger meals with shakes shouldn't be almost $30.,0
Really did not like it here at all. Food was not particularly great either. I ordered a Ruben sandwich it had a weird aftertaste. I will not visit this place again.,0
"Worst service ever, sat at the bar for 25 minutes and not getting served or greeted. The will only serve the regulars which there where only five other people there. Pissed off and left.",0
"Friendly service, fresh and delicious food -- A truly local and consistently excellent establishment!",0
"Nobody asked us for help including the greeter. 3 employees walked right passed us without offering to help us, expected more for a Home Depot. Giving 3 stars only because the store had alot of stock on the product I was looking for.",0
"\""When music was music, and lyrics were lyrics\""",0
"Lots of containers and vessles for your weed, clothing made from weed, signs and posters with weed topics.  This is your familiar college town head shop.  Nothing has changed.",0
Great gluten-free choices and like the new menu options!  Our server Patrick was great!!,0
3.5 for experience. It's a great diner and atmosphere is fitting. Overall good grease spoon but don't expect anything special/different from a quality of good perspective.,0
Slowest McDonald's I have ever been too. Nice staff but slow. Literally sat in line in drive through 10-15 mins at the window on three separate occasions. If you go inside it's worse.,0
Lobster was not fully cooked. Eewweee,0
"will not return because management will not accept certain coupons! and he was very rude! you'll know who he is, hes very big.",0

I ordered a thin crust pizza for carry out from this location.  The staff was very friendly and the pizza was pretty good.  I look forward to trying their pasta in the near future.,0
Delicious Ribs and they have Big Red soda on fountain? what's not to love?!,0
Doesn't taste authentic at all. Food looks amazing but lacks in flavor. Also the curry has no bamboo shoots in it which is disappointing.,0
"Nice place; here for a baseball tourney with my son and wife, and they take care of everything. Boys comfortable, good part of town. Couldn't ask for more - good value.",0
If you are ever in town the ying yong is awesome. This is a very unique and excellent restaurant. I would highly recommend.,0
"PetSmart kind of irritates me in general (high prices, questionable merchandise, the whole Banfield scam...) but this location goes beyond irritating. They never have what I want in stock.",0
Tastes like Mexican food made by Canadians. It was so far from anything that I think of as Mexican food. I won't be back.,0
Great tasting food! Server needs to listen better!! When the food got to the table right it was outstanding!! P.S. had to wait 10 minutes to be seated in a 1/2 empty restaurant.,0
Most companies charge less than $75 for a diagnostic. Always shop around and get a 2nd opinion.,0
"I go there since it's right across the street from the dog park and they sell Canidae dog food. Prices are reasonable and the people are friendly. They have a great selection of products, too.",0
Consistently good food. And I think the staff there does a great job. Wish they'd start serving breakfast though,0
"Like most food establishments in this part of Tempe, the price is right.  The sandwiches are pretty good too.  My one complaint is the lighting.  I'm not supposed to look green under any lighting.",0
"The food is pretty good. The atmosphere leaves something to be desired.  \n\nI liked the potatoes quite a bit, and the sausage.\n\nI didn't like the overcrowded nature of the place.",0
The bartender was a bitch. She was young and inattentive and spent the whole time chatting with her boyfriend at the end of the bar. He is also a jerk. My whole group left after 1 round.,0
Closest thing to the real thing on the west coast great food,0
Breakfast is fantastic.  Work on the coffee selection.  Only thing holding back a star is no French press coffee or an espresso machine,0
This is by far my long-standing favorite for food at the Memorial Library carts.,0
"We usually road trip to San Diego several times a year and have always talked about stopping at Space Diner and today we finally did.  The employees were friendly, bathrooms very clean and the food was good!  We would stop again!",0
I have been eating at Harolds for almost 15 years. I have probably eaten every item off menu. One of my favorites is the Cajun Prime Rib. Still my favorite place to go eat and hang out.,0
This is a no-nonsense pizza delivery place.  Always relable and always good.,0
Michelle is by far the best server here.  When you go to this Outback be sure to ask for Michelle if she's available.\n\nDuring the holiday's get a Gingerbread Martini.  Yum!!,0
"We go there for most of our fresh foods, it doesn't have the feel of a neighborhood grocer but the quality and selection are terrific.",0

"First time in Vegas, last time at Little Darling. Read all the other negative reviews and you have my review summed up.",0
My son was served raw chicken in his sandwich here today. Totally raw and cold.\nHe ate half his sandwich before his fiance noticed. We all lost our lunch!,0
I hate this airport I always get lost. The driver can never find me I just hate it. Literally it took the driver like an hour to find me.,0
What a great store! So much to look at with reasonable prices. Always find unique finds and friendly help.,0
Stopped for lunch with two friends. They had quiche and I had a tuna salad sandwich. All were very good.,0
"Service was excellent. Our tea and water was refilled all the time,never had to waive at the servers to get their attention. And the only Chinese restaurant Ived ever been too that servers smiled and was very nice lol.",0
Just. No. \n\nThey rushed all of our mani/pedis. Looked like I could have done them. Not worth it. At all.,0
I am a regular and love this diner! But it was 94 degrees in there today!,0
Obviously it's a buffet so they use very very low quality ingredients I can't imagine anything being worse than this in terms of Chinese food.,0
"went there again yesterday, had a bit of a wait (which is nothing considering the amazing service) but after getting my haircut I was pleased to say my hair looks amazing once again thanks to Rosa",0
"Good enough airport that's easy enough to navigate.  Okay food options, as well.  Nothing special and nothing bad.",0
Worst service dept on the face of the earth even when it got sold DON'T TAKE YOUR MAZDA there ever and the star is because I have to,0
"Food was good, our waiter was great. Almost a perfect experience except the hostess bitch was RUDE (fat one)!!",0
"It's simple, if you end up here you made a bad decision. The promoter offered us free drinks, and free rides and we got neither of those. When you confront the staff they  blow you off and your instantly to intoxicated.",0
"Love their burgers. Have not tried anything else except onion rings and fries, but this is my 'THE' place for burgers.",0
"I love the chicken sandwich there, but everytime I get it's very dry and when you go thru the drive thru they are extremely slow.",0
"This had always been my favorite Applebee's. Consistently good perfect margaritas, quick seating, great Happy Hour!",0
It's Denny's.  What can I say.  Typical chain food.  Service is good.  Kids love it.  Comfortable atmosphere.  Prices are low.,0
Very comfortable atmosphere; like being in their family dining room. Service is very warm and friendly and quick!! $8 for a chicken lunch special with soup and egg roll is awesome. Will definitely be back!,0
"Haven't been here in about 11 years (moved away).  Food was great, fresh fish, awesome quality.  Service was a little lacking, but still good stuff.",0
"Speedy service, homemade food, feels quaint and full of character, reasonable pricing, yummy iced coffee and lots of open parking! Definitely worth stopping by :-)",0
The restaurant is a classic family owned mexican cantina vibe with quality food and a fun atmosphere. The menu is large and the drinks are strong. Definite a solid place to check out.,0
Everything you want in a good bar: Strong drinks. Quick bartenders. Cheap pool tables. Good jukebox.\n\nAmazing little hooks in the high tables for pool cues. \n\nYes. Go there.,0
"Really not bad as hotel buffets in Vegas go.....  Relatively inexpensive, not much of a line, decent selection and, for buffet food, not bad.",0
Saigon Palace doesn't stack up to Ben Thanh or Pho Hoa but I do think they're better than Saigon grill up the street so if you're on South blvd and need some Vietnamese I'd come here instead.,0
"Don't ever try their wonton noodles, it tasted exactly like the instant wonton noodles except that it was worse.",0
"Great little place, lot's of games to play, cheap drinks. Needs more pool tables, or patrons who are willing to let other people play, and not hog the table.",0
"If you're in the mood for a mediocre burrito as big as your leg, you're in the right place.",0
"They'll steal your money, then threaten you. Stop keeping  scum in business.",0
This place been here for a while and finally stopped to give it a try. Glad we did. The service is good and the food is exceptional.,0
Greatest Starbucks on earth. Baristas are awesome and they keep it personal by remembering my name.,0
"Food was good, but don't set your expectations too high. Good thing it's only $1 extra for homemade pasta, I couldn't tell the difference. \nAll in all, good but not worth a long wait!",0
"Never had a bad meal here and the service is awesome. I recommend \""Lucy\"" as your server. I only come for breakfast but am always happy. I'm here right now!",0
Try the sweet potato fries with a side of honey mustard instead of ketchup. Linda and the rest of the ladies at the bar are awesme.,0
This is worst restaurant ever. It ruined my vegas trip.,0
"Awful, awful, awful...  The worst of the worst of the cookie-cutter Chinese restaurants.  Food without flavor, a menu without imagination and a staff of such profound indifference it's hard to tell they're even there.",0
Ordered a ham & pineapple pizza for delivery after hearing good things but was sadly disappointed. The crust was more like cardboard & overall the pie basically tasteless. Hope this was an anomaly but probably won't try again. My guests concurred...,0
"Food is good, if not great.  The owners are very friendly.  Portion sizes are large.  They were very accommodating of our children.",0
Love your pizza but the service is BAD.  Management needs to keep an eye on the service.  There are a thousand pizza places in the valley and when dining in service is important.,0
They do not respect our flag!!! A business should have more respect for our country and address issues like this.,0
"Food was good, decor is a bit old.. is a good place to stop if you are in the area but would not go out of my way for it.",0
Love this place! The orange chicken is one of the best tasting and their service has always been great.,0
Will buy a grill and some meat and try my own hand before I go back.,0
"The white pizza truly is delicious, as are all of their fatty appetizers.  They also offer pasta and other options so there is something to please everyone in any size group you bring to Bado's.",0
I've eaten at ztejas a ton of times and this was my worst visit. 45 minutes to get our food. Manager never even came by!,0
Solid place to grab a martini and listen to some sub-par live music. Far from amazing but hey not everywhere is going to be right?,0
I confirmed with restaurant.com that the voucher was valid and that the owner acted in an inappropriate manner.  AVOID PITA HOUSE.,0
Very poor service. Unremarkable at best.,0
I asked for no onions and pickles but I might as well have asked for a punch in the mouth because I got neither.,0
Great service and okay food. I ordered 5-Spicy level (where 4 is Thai hot) and the food came out tasting sweet. I love La's Thai on McDowell and Hayden much better,0
One of our favorite burger joints in Phoenix.  It's a little dive bar/restaurant and the burgers are so good.  We drive 10 miles from home to get one.  Definitely recommend.,0
My cousin recommended this place. Its ok.\n\nI had half of Cotton Candy and the other was Creme Brulee.,0
"The area seemed a little sketchy at night, but the Columbia Outlet (the only one we shopped at) was awesome with awesome prices. What more can I say other than I wished there were one in San Diego!",0

"food was expensive, service was a-ok. mediocore",0
"Love the accommodating menu and atmosphere.. I can't wait to go back, I'm already craving their chicken basil.. umm umm good!!",0
"From the outside it doesn't look like much, but the giant breakfast burrito is delicious and huge!!!",0
"Eh, Alfredo is better at Olive Garden and spaghetti was bland BUT calamari and stuffed mushrooms are amazing! Love they take you to your seat through the kitchen. I'd recommend appetizers and Italian soda :) servers are great, friendly atmosphere",0
"We just ordered out for hot & sour soup, and it was great. One of the best we've had here in Phoenix. Ordered again...not better, but worse",0
"Ended up finding a piece of glass in my boyfriends pie at this location, waiting for them to take action. I dont trust the pies anymote",0
"Great food at reasonable prices. Not the most comfortable seating and the tables are crammed together pretty tight, but again the food is worth the trip.",0
"AS far as libraries go, this one is a keeper.  Beautiful building, great selection, and lots of space to work or read.  I can't complain.",0
"Very good tamales. Very large, beautifully appointed building. That said, you will get better atmosphere, service, and, not surprisingly, better tamales in the parking lot of el Super.",0
Service is so bad. Waitress keep continue to ask same things over and over again,0
"My husband and I have really enjoyed our weekly visits to Moto Sushi.  We love the location, and the vibe inside as well. All the sashimi and rolls have been wonderful.  Thank you!  Highly suggest visiting!",0
"Awesome gym. Great trainers and facilities. Would definitely recommend this place. More expensive than most gyms but you get what you pay for. If you can get past the lady at the front desk being rude, you're golden!!",0
"Ug, never had been, never will go again.  It's a sad thing when Taco Bell is better than something.",0
"Not sure what happened but the beans were watery and had ZERO flavor, the tacos were not crispy at all and the carne asada was bland... First time in YEARS we had bad food here. I hope they recover.",0
"It's an ok casino.  However it is not on the strip, so it will be quieter. Generally will see more locals than tourists here.  Always have seen friendly staff, and food has been good.",0
"Good flavorful food, long wait for food to get done, myself and two kids, above the \""average price\""",0
"Don't let the location fool you.  The food, service and embience is fabulous. We are definitely going back - best Italian we've had in a long time!",0
"Convenient, safe, easy, anonymous. Perfect for an illicit tryst away from anyone you might know.",0
Crooked haircut. Had to go elsewhere to have fixed,0
Very good food and good service. Extensive kids menu as well.,0
The staff was less than attentive... Left a hostess station waiting.  Food covered in eel sauce not sure what they were covering up and staff very unfriendly!!! Not coming back!!,0
"Service is quick and to the point, the place is full of smoke because they bbq in the restaurant need more vent.\nRare beef noodle soup is one of my favorite.",0
"If you are trying to decide what charity is most worthy of your contributions, donate to Gracie's Cottage.  Come see for yourself how this thrift store does everything from supporting the local community to supporting missionaries around the world.",0
"Not really a sushi place. More like a sports bar. They are the kings of spicy imitation crab. It's everywhere, on everything. Even just laying around the plate for \""presentation\"". This is our last visit.",0
"Great deep dish pizza, great salads. Deep dish always hits the spot.",0
This is a very clean airport and loaded with places to eat and drink.  Plus the wireless internet was great as well,0
Love the free wi-fi and the fly by lanes in terminal 4.\nI'll probably bump up my review once all the new food choices get in!,0
Not sure I will be coming back here ever.  Yuck all around.  I Dare say McDonalds might be better.,0
My opinion of the food and service has not changed. But they have gotten a bad habit of not opening on time. Sometimes up to 2 hours late!,0
Cool outlet. Need to have Boudin Sourdough Bowls. Reasonable Price on Bread and cookies,0
"our wedding at mon bel ami was personal, professional, the photography was outstanding. I felt like a princess from beginning to end!!'",0
A small coffee is now $2.50 \n\n\n\nLol.,0
"Always excellent food, atmosphere could use an update.  Service tends to be slow and the waitresses can be very moody at times.  It seems that service and ambience are not a priority.",0
"Their food is really bland, no flavor at all! Overpriced for tasteless food! A whole in the wall place with tasteless food!",0
I've been coming here for years! I enjoy the pizza a lot. I like how crispy the bottom crust is. As long as things don't change you can expect to see me back time after time!,0

A Starbucks is a Starbucks but this one is difficult to find parking,0

Good place with decent drink prices.  Wish they were open a little earlier...,0

One of my favorite breakfast places in Madison.  The salmon hash is a dream.  And Tim bakes the best biscuits in town!,0
"Was craving for Machaca con Huevo's this morning!  This is the first time I've been here for Breakfast, no lines no wait!!!  Freshly made tortilla as usual.",0
Definitely a smaller home repair place but it's in the neighborhood and very convenient. They have just enough. Prices are pretty good too.,0
Had another wonderful dinner with great friendly service. Will be coming back to try out some of their other delicious baked sushi next time!,0
There's better greasy pizza to be had when you're drunk and craving food that's bad for you (particularly now that there's an Ian's on State St).  I might consider this pizza almost inedible if not drunk.,0
Waited 15 minutes while 2 servers at bar. Was never acknowledged and decided not worth the wait at 3 in the afternoon. Manager was kind however the customer service was at it poorest. Headed to On The Boarder!,0
Super tasty and good value for your buck!  The chicken fried steak with biscuits and gravy and eggs is unbelievable and will put you in the grave from its richness!,0

"Great and convenient!  Delivery was prompt and friendly! Mozzarella sticks were perfect even with the delivery, burger was delicious and so were the chicken wings. The best part of all, the brownie!!!",0
"I had the lunch special, cermitas, it was phenomenal! One of the best bbq sandwiches I've had ever. The prices are great, especially for the amount of food served. Service was speedy & friendly.",0
Casino wise specifically craps these dealers are not friendly.  They nit pick scold you about random things.  It makes you not enjoy gambling.,0
"Horrible service...with no respect.  I ordered kalbi dish, the meat tasted over-date, the rice was not fresh.  There were flies flying around, nasty",0
The food was greasy. BBQ sauce wasn't good at all. I went to try out their restaurant because the food looked good on triple Ds. Turned out the food wasn't worth the drive,0

"Nice Whole Foods, friendly staff.  Always stop at WF when traveling for on the road salads.",0

"The only thing that kept it from being a 2 star rating was the food. The service was awful, all the wait staff did was complain about the hostess putting people in their areas.",0
Sister Sister  does amazing work.  And they are super fast at what they do.\nI recommend this place for braiding and weaves.,0
"what Jea J said is all true,I also retained Mr Pontoni and with poor results.There are more qualified attornies out there that might actually care about you and your case and not be so weak.",0
"It looks a little scary, but don't let the carpet on the floors scare you. The food was fantastic. I would eat here again.",0
A lot of cool stuff. I came by to donate old uniforms and the owner gave me a new pair of boots in exchange.,0
"Monkeys could do a better job.  The staff do not think about what they are doing or what is important to the car, only follow a checklist",0
...for selling broccoli at a good price I gave them a chance.\n...for selling celery that was already rotting I won't do so again.,0

"Fun atmosphere, mixed crowd (some young and some older), decent food - live music and trivia nights. Been going for years, but it seems to be going down hill a little, or maybe I am just getting old!",0
"Avoid this place in the airport. 20 minutes to wait for a standard order is not acceptable. I had to wolf down my food to make my flight when I should have had plenty of time. Epic fail BK, clean up your act.",0

Did not get to eat in as they were packed when lunch was catered at work their pita bread was nice and warm-delishus!,0
"It's an ok store.  Typically the cashiers are goofing off, deli is horribly slow or takes forever to acknowledge you.",0
Ate here twice during vacation! The Loco Moco is one of the best! The Spam Musubi was perfect and at a good price! Definetly coming back!,0
"Over Rated and to crowded.  Go to Mi Patio or La Canasta instead.  Or, go a little further north to Via Delosantos for even better food and drinks!",0

Great Chinese restaurant\nRestaurant is Clean food is fresh and flavorful.  \nSupport family owned and operated,0

"Great atmosphere, took us even though we were an hour early for our reservation, the steak salad was amazing. Service was awesome. Only thing that could have made it better was more tv's for football that was on!",0
This is my 2nd time eating here it is a bit pricey but the food was very good!,0
Never been disappointed by the food at the roasting company. I would say they use high quality ingredients and it's always super tasty. Prices are reasonable for the quality! We go whenever we're in the SouthPark area.,0
Great old school diner with some tasty comfort food.,0

Amazing store. Great location. Knowledgeable staff. \nThey team working knows the products and love the outdoors.,0
Best coffee I've ever tasted! Being able to watch them roast the beans right in front of me was pretty cool as well.,0
This place smells like cat piss.  Like 100 cats use it as their litter box.  I don't even understand how a place can smell so much like cat piss.,0

Food is great and it comes out fast.  I usually end up at the waffle house at night so I can't comment on the day shift.  It's one of my favorite places to grab a quick bite late at night.,0
Good food but awful service. Hostess was friendly and the monkey cakes were awesome. Bloody Mary's were really good but it took 30 minutes for our food and thats unreasonable for breakfast.,0

I've done karaoke for 15 years and the guy tonite is easily the worst I've ever witnessed. Sound system sucks and frankly the DJ blows...,0
"Thought I would give Toppers a try.  Very friendly staff, informative and good pizza to boot.  Thanks guys for helping a first timer and I will be back!",0
"Great beer selection.  Not a whole lot of women, but I guess thats not what its all about.  Pool tables in back, nice patio seating, big screen projector for sporting events.  Specials everyday.",0
"Pizza is ok, sauce is kinda bland,  but these wings are not good.  Wings have the taste of old or burnt oil",0
There's a lady named Mari who's too unfriendly for  customer service that has worked the past couple of times we have eaten here.,0
Friendly staff great food prices are reasonable but some items are a little over priced.,0
Get the asiago cheese bagel with sun-dried tomato cream cheese!!!!!!!!!,0

"We have two larger dogs and a cat which have been given good care over the years here. This place doesn't seem to do too much thats unneccessary, and not much upselling when you go in. Caring staff.",0
"If you like ribs, these are to die for. They are cooked in a process that lasts 3 days. These ribs are so tender, they fall off the bone. Even good to have extras for the next day for leftovers.",0
"Service slow. Food was partly cold and they didn't have the specials like the one my husband and I go to in Escondido, ca.  If you have a local hooters my bet is its better. Stick with that!",0

The only place I feel it's acceptable to have a drink...or more at an airport.,0

The service was slow and the restaurant is dated. The price and quality of food do not match up. Fun for once but maybe not again.,0
"Gross! I ordered a turkey sandwich. Just awful. The bread was falling apart and hard, the meat tasted terrible, like plain ol' lunch meat. Overpriced and definitely not worth it. Don't waste your time or money!",0

"Pretty much my favorite chain Mexican food. Although you have a lot of choice for great Mexican food in the area, it's a pretty good place and has a lot of menu choices",0
Food was good but not hot. Service was lacking and slow. With many empty tables it was a surprise that getting another drink or being offered dessert was difficult.,0

Fun shop with thousands of unique costumes for rent/sale. The staff are very helpful and know their stuff. For Halloween they rent most costumes for the entire month at their regular rate.,0
Wonderful Italian food. Especially love their salads and breads. Never been disappointed with any dish they've served. Nice atmosphere and wonderful staff. One of our favorite restaurants.,0
Gorton's in the toaster is better than this vile crap. They charge extra for their bad tartar sauce. Avoid.,0
"The lunch buffet is really great, everything is fresh and full of interesting flavor - nothing is spicy hot, though. Friendly staff.",0
Love their wings! Great service. One of my favorite sports bars in the Valley.,0
Love Bingo. its my favorite place to play. The dual action should pay $200. and i wish it was a little cheaper but i always pick here to play,0
Grade: B-\n\nCheap drinks. Good food. College bar.,0
I really miss the Northstar Amber but the specialty beers are always good.  Food is excellent and the service staff is friendly.,0
The manager was very unprofessional and rude. 1 star  because the cashier wanted to please the customer and had a positive attitude.,0
Big surprise -- looks like the merger with American will take away most of the benefits US Airways loyalists enjoyed.  Time to bail out and find another airline.  Better check to see how you will lose out!,0
Just left there and my car was inspected quickly and no hidden costs.  The staff was efficient and quick and that's all I can ask.,0
"Cool environment, awesome service & the Mocha Especiale (I think that's how you spell it) is too die for!!!!",0
"My husband and I like to come here on Sunday mornings for bloody Mary's, its hard to find a cocktail on a Sunday morning so this is our to go place when we want to waste away a day",0
"To my knowledge, this is one of the last Pizza huts with a lunch buffet. Friendly staff, had a great time.",0
"Excellent steaks and ambience. To me, the price of the steak was justified by the cut and the flavor.",0
Food is great but this time I was with two other friends. Each person's plate of food came out one at a time and at 10-15 minutes apart. So we basically all ate one at a time. Very poor service.,0
"Okay, I came back and ordered the Beef Noodle Soup, and again I was disappointed.  The beef noodle soup was not tasty.  I will not be returning again.",0
The food and drinks where great. This place was full of specials from 55 cents wings to happy hour drink specials! The waiter was friendly and helpful. I look forward to coming back again.,0
Tried the BBQ ribs and the chicken sate. Sate was very good. The ribs were a little too chewy for me. All in all it was pretty good.,0
Staff was friendly. I wasn't impressed with the desserts. What happened to all the puddings? Ice cream or dry brownie muffin.,0
"Great Sonoran enchiladas.  Very flavorful, authentic Mexican food.",0
"had the bean burro. can't really mess up beans, but their hot sauce is too tomato-ey and not spicy enough.",0
"After waiting in the drive thru for about a half an hour with only three cars ahead of us, came home to open the bag with someone else's order... Fail!",0
"Really enjoyed my Gyro for lunch today. The family run restaurant is fun, positive, friendly and yummy!",0
"The new item on the menu is BBQ.  Marty has nailed it. Smokey, meaty and great prices. Definitely worth a visit or two.",0
"Service is mostly good. Been there a few times, and still don't get that home feel. But, the beer is good, the service is timely, and the food is fantastic! Awesome Reuben!",0
After being repeat customers we had the worst experience with customer service. Since that time we have not been back and will not return.,0
Another fantastic place on the east side.  I love to pick up a dozen for my colleagues on my way to work!!!,0
One of my favorite traditional (more NY style) Italian food here in AZ.  A total joint just like a mom and pop pizza place in NY.  My son's absolutely favorite place.  Service always very good.,0
Kind of Pricey compared to Wal-Mart but I found it less crowded it was ok,0
"This is probably some of the best Asian cuisine in Charlotte. The menu is comprehensive, the service is pretty good and I haven't had a bad meal yet. \n\nIt is great for take out too!",0
"Had wonderful dinner tonight,service was wonderful, over all  great time had by all",0
I've been here several times and the service has always been quick and friendly. The food has always been tasty and hot.,0
Not impressed. The service was below average. Food ok. Atmosphere very nice.,0
Great bar. They have great food specials everyday. Sports bar with 10 TV's. Bartenders are the best in Tempe. 5 stars.,0
"I had a delightfully salty sandwich. Although the wait was longer than acceptable---over half an hour---it was about worth it. I probably won't return unless gifted with free time, but it was a nice one shot.",0
"Before you have granite work done by them, PLEASE ask to see our pictures. Terrible, extremely noticeable and customer service unprofessional.  rerr3@cox.net",0
Best phone in town! Always piping hot  made with love and a great menu. Check it out. You will not be disappointed,0
I ordered a Caesar Salad to go.  Never have I a paid 9.00 for a worst salad. I was unaware the Greeks use brown old lettuce and Romaine,0
"When something goes wrong, they don't stand behind the food they sell.",0
Great service! Prices were very reasonable and they were ALL so friendly!,0
The coke still has a funny taste. I was hoping after they remodeled that that would be fixed.,0
"Been there three times in 2 years, always disappointed by the quality of both food and service.",0
"Been here several times. Fairly convenient parking, good places to eat. Just a nice airport as airports go.",0
The chips and salsa were pretty tastie.  The guac was pretty bad though and it almost ruined the chimy.  The shredded beef didn't have much flavor to it.  Cant say I'll be going back any time soon.,0
"Surprised that this is still listed, they have been closed for a couple of years now... Hmmm..",0
Currently still waiting for my food. It's over 30 minutes late and I ordered 1.5 hours ago.,0
Extremely slow delivery and the food is mediocre.,0
Owner was cool. They had a humidor. Good stuff! Fine cigars! Late night tip. Great spot found on my yelp app.,0
"Just moved to the neighborhood and decided to stop by for lunch on Saturday around 12:30pm. The door was locked, lights were off and chairs were still on the tables... not sure why they were not open during their regular business hours!",0
"The service is outstanding. Portions are large, and meals are relatively cheap. Always yummy!",0
This place has way bigger portions than Panda Express and the price is the same! Plus free delivery and free spring rolls with delivery...can't beat it! Wish they stayed open super late though! :D,0
"I wasn't here very long, but I was able to find some good food & drink easily!",0
"The Quality is Good, the prices can be a little Steep. I lived behind this place for a year unaware it was here, might want to advertise location a little better.",0
I was delayed at this airport and I must say I was really happy to see a spa there. I got a 20 minute massage for $30 and it was worth every minute.,0
"Has been going downhill for years. Used to be my favorite place. Recommend they dig out menus and decor from 10 years back. Tries to be upscale, but fails. It was better when it was fun and friendly.",0
I only had a simple word doc to print; needed 17 copies. They were the cheapest and super quick. Glad I went there.,0
I appreciate the education I'm getting at such a good price. The classes are challenging in a good way.\nIf only we would become more acclaimed by the time I graduate that'd be great!,0
Over priced sandwiches!!!\nTasteless Flank Steak Sandwich (nothing else) and a bottled coke $16\nSurrounding area with picnic tables was nice though.,0
Have the gravy and biscuits they were really good along with two turkey patties.  Service was outstanding.,0
"After reading the reviews I decided to stop by and I was a little disappointed, not as good as all the reviews suggested.",0
Good food.\nGood service.\nSeems to be my local go to Chinese restaurant.,0
"I'll admit, there isn't much to choose from in terms of Indian in Phoenix.  The prices are reasonable here, but it makes me yearn for good Indian food.  This just isn't that.",0
"Sorry, but you automatically go into meh territory when cashier is presented with a coupon, stares at it for 2 minutes, and says quite audibly oh shit and scurries off to get a manager.",0
"I ate this food for 10 years until they decided to not deliver my food and not answer the telephone. Do not order from this place. I REPEAT, DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE.",0
This is to balance out Elizabeth A's idiotic one star review.  You don't give a one-star review because YOU left your cell phone charger behind and they didn't send it back to you on their dime.  Moron.,0
"We stayed recently in a very nice suite. Beautiful decor -- especially the tile floors in the entry, bathroom & powder room. Really enjoyed the spa and pool here. Standard Marriott level of service.",0
I guess planning the towel service is a bit difficult for this group.  Bring a towel if you want one. Half the time I come here there are no towels.,0
"The pizza here is OK, the staff here is friendly, and they have good daily deals.",0
"Great job framing a canvas piece that I brought back from Panama. On time and relatively good pricing, I think. Either way I love the piece and the work they did on it.",0
"Had the calzone Saturday. REALLY good. As usual, great service, friendly people, plenty of sports. A great spot.",0
It all depends on the chef who is performing for you. I have been here twice in last several months and felt everything was average. I have seen other chefs in different restaurants and they have put on a much better show.,0
Sometimes I get lucky and find something. But personally I never find anything at any of these thrift shops but friends I go with always find something good.,0
"Every time I've been in here, the staff acted like they had better things to do than help their customer. They are also grossly overpriced on most things.",0
Two words: soggy pizza.  Service is the only reason I am giving two stars instead of one.,0
"Its just pizza. Not bad. Taste good actually. However, downfall is price. Its not cheap!",0
They gave me lemons for my fish tacos because they were out of limes. Other than that it was a decent Baja Fresh.,0
"Not the best haircut, nor the worst, I might go back, I might not...I keep waiting to find a reason to stay.  The price was good enough that I'll give it one more try and update you then!",0
The Macaroons here are wonderful! Definitely trying out other bakery next time!,0
I love a breakfast place that has healthy options and free pie :-),0
"Large, clean, friendly staff, mist machines outside",0
"My very favorite place to have breakfast in Madison for 20 years! We go there every weekend. The spinach crepe is my personal favorite, but just about anything on the menu is great.",0
"The store is small, but it carries specialties that are difficult to find in Pittsburgh. I was particularly excited to find middle eastern chili sauce and chocolate covered Turkish delights.",0
Lately it seems their standards have gone down. The chicken is dry when I order white meat. If im paying extra I would expect better tasting food.,0
Cool Irish spot with a new outdoor patio. No food and a limited draft and bottled beer selection.  Free WiFi.  The hostess is gorgeous so I would drink there anytime.,0
"The pizza was burnt. Not \""a little burnt,\"" either. One side of the crust was black.",0
They changed the menu. NO fried lasagna anymore. No burgers on the dinner menu. The menu is very limited. The food is good but pricey.,0
Houston's is a great environment and great service. Not to tough on the wallet either!! I recommend when in Scottsdale,0
The soup was too salty and heavy and the panang chicken was kinda blend. I've had it better at a Chinese restaurant in CO.,0
This was my third time eating here and by far the best. Everything was perfectly prepared but the best of all was our waiter Sal. He was perfectly attentive without being invasive and made the evening the best ever! Thanks Sal,0
"Service was good, food was horrible. Nothing had flavor, food was cold, tasteless and gross. We had to run through McDonald's to get my wife something and that was better than good china.  Would not recommend it",0
Solid 3 stars. Limited menu. Would like to go back and try the specials during the week & Happy Hour...,0
"We love to enjoy the \""feast for two\"" and try an array of freshly prepared, delicious dishes. The lamb is marvelous as is the fresh pita.",0
"Some of my favorites here: white pizza, BLT (with FENNEL!!!) caprese salad, and of course the salt river bar.  I love this place!",0
"Stellar beer selection, and though I am not a huge pizza person I loved theirs.  Service is always available a moment before you know you need another beer.  Great happy hour prices and atmosphere.",0
Took for ever just to get water and to take our order. We were there for over an hour before we got our food and it was cold. Will not return.,0
Food was ok. Waitress was a huge air head. Waited 25 min for my $7.00 beer. Only got it after I reminded her. It is just another disappointing chain restaurant disguised as a local commodity.,0
"A bit too pricy for what I get. I've never been big on hyped-up health bar type places, especially when it's not all that healthy.",0
"It's pricier than supercuts or great clips, but they're kid friendly and we always get a super cut from Kristi. My daughter loves the princess station!",0
"Always a pleasure to come here!  Genuinely awesome staff, short wait time, painless  donation process.  I love the ARC and this is my absolute favorite place to donat",0
Not as great as it used to be but still some of the better Mexican food you'll get in the northwest valley.,0
It's the Olive Garden. Same as any other. And that's the point.,0
"Live music, great bruschetta, great service",0
Got my skates sharpened at this location and didn't realize until I stepped on the ice that they didn't sharpen them at all. They took all the edge off and made it a flat surface. Ice den fixed my problem..,0
"Ugh, so slow, and not friendly, they could care less if they have your business, and the food shows it.",0
"Absolutely the nicest folks here, the service is incredible. The food is always fresh and IMO very good. I've been going here for 5 years and the experience is consistently excellent",0
If i am craving Korean BBQ this is the place i come. They always have great tasting Bulgogi/Kalbi and the Banchans they offer are great. The service is always good and attentive.,0
First time they scratched my truck... Second chance I sat in line for 5 minutes. No one greeted me so I left.,0
I love their Chicken Enchilada plate! Great place! Try it!,0
"Favorite Thai spot for sure. Great curry dishes, fresh vegetables and a relaxing atmosphere. Great hangover food and cheap lunch specials!",0
"The jewel of downtown Las Vegas hotels by far. We stayed in the older Carson Tower, but it's still way above any other hotel in this area. Staff was very helpful and friendly.",0
"Simply the best ambiance, food, and service. Eddie and Giovanni are in a class by themselves for professional, accomodating service. Another great meal last night.",0
Great location to purchase all your cheap gifts needs!,0
"Pretty good pizza. Not bad, not the best. Kinda pricey... The staff is super friendly, which makes the 4 stars.",0
"Veg burgers in Vegas.  I was ecstatic!  Add on the skinny fries, and you have a great meal for about $8 and for Green Valley Ranch, that is a huge bargain.",0
"Just got four new tires here from Tanner and Brent.  On a Thursday morning, they had me in and out in 30 minutes.  Couldn't have been easier.",0
I purchased a Groupon for a haircut and I had Chelsea as my stylist. She was very friendly and talkative. I absolutely loved how my hair turned out and I will be back to see her again!,0
"Great little place. All the sushi was good, but the flying fish roe was put together loose and the eggs spilled in my soy sauce :[ but they were still good. Very friendly sushi chefs.",0
Average strip mall Mexican food place.. Food was alright and priced reasonably. I got an array of tacos. I felt the side effects later so I marked a star off for that.,0
Descent fish tacos but their ceviche had fake lime juice(the bottled kind) those were only ok,0
"bad service, bad food, just bad all around!!",0
Pretty decent coffee shop and its open until midnight on weekdays.\n\nThe coffee was good and the staff were nice. I will go back. Nothing spectacular.,0
Higher end restaurant. You should probably dress up. Pre-nights are held here.\n\nI'd only recommend going here only for happy hour appetizer specials and drinks\n\nOff-campus in Urbana.,0
Great Pizza! The slice specials are a good price. The wings are good. The large pies can get expensive but I have no compliants about taste.,0
The food tastes good but is extremely bland and so lacks the Indian experience. \n\nThe servers were not a friendly and approachable. However the service was quick.,0
"This place is so horrible, with the Air conditioning being so hot out side they must keep it at 80 degrees, The restrooms are GROSS and uncleaned...",0
Chipotle is great for a quick lunch. I like their concept and the rapid order/eat system. It's not much for ambiance but likely healthier than most fast food around.,0
Going in to look for a Starbuck's plastic cups.  Didn't find the one we are looking for...  The staff was not so friendly.,0
"I pretty much now come here regularly for the soft tofu, beef & kimchi soup. It really is fantastic.\nOne day I'll branch out and try other foods, but for now, the tofu soup is what I need.",0
Your only choice for movies if you're on the east side.  Older theater shows the current films but don't expect anything extraordinary from here.,0
Nice airport with good dining choices. The US Airways Lounge is great too.,0
"Continue to be horrible. Now I ordered carpet, they input the wrong one, when I communicate this they tell me the carpet I ordered 12/24 is no longer carried! This store is a train wreck.",0
"Service was awesome! It was a short wait despite obviously being slammed. The mechanics were quite pleasant and forthcoming with everything. If anything, I'd say they were hesitant to recommend services I needed. Overall, I was satisfied.",0
The atmosphere was nice and the food was decent. The service was just okay maybe because they were a little bit busy. Not sure if I will return.,0
"Best late night place to eat after a night of partying and whatevers.  Good food, nuff said.",0
"This was the worst food I've ever had. I ordered to-go and not only did they get my entire order wrong and the food was awful, they charged me double for it. Do not recommend!!!",0
"Meh - it's not that there was anything bad about the pizza, it just didn't blow me away or anything.  Good for a quick lunch at the counter.",0
It was dark inside the cages and the pitches were very inconsistent. The guy in the cage next to me got beaned by a pitch. No bueno.,0
Great place! Very friendly people and a huge selection. Nice to see birds not in cages.,0
"The coffee there was just ok, but pastries were good there. a great place if you were on the go, and want something light.",0
two stars based solely on the bar and happy hour. Service sucked and happy hour prices don't make me happy,0
This is a great experience!!!  Anyone visiting Arizona should do this!,0
"the best sauce ever!\n\nrib meat scares me, but the sauce MMMMmmmmmMMMM!!!",0
They like to run expensive tests and we believe them to be dishonest. We had been going there for years but no more.,0
I've been here and ordered the ribs. They're pretty good. Nothing really stand out. The red velvet cake is pretty good though.,0
The food was great. Although customer service is a bit fuzzy but over all I like this place. They kept me coming back =D,0
Great place for breakfast. Definitely a go to place.,0
"Have stayed here several times. Nothing fancy but clean, quiet, and excellent price. I recommend if you're not looking for high-dollar, five star hotel but want a good basic place to stay",0
"The BBQ pork fried rice was too Americanized.  But the other items were delicious.  Good dinner deal, comes with soup and rice.",0
"Service was good and I didn't need to wait long for my pedicure. My biggest issue is that credit cards are *not* accepted. Get a square, please!",0
Excellent beer selection and laid back atmosphere.  Love that they have some games to play too.,0
"If you like waiting for a long time for your appointment, dealing with rude medical professionals, and getting yelled at later when you want your test results sent to your primary care doctor, this is the place for you to go.",0
"Food was very good and it came out quickly.  Only issue was the waitress, had to ask for two menus, then we ordered two beers but only got one, then getting enough to go boxes was challenging.",0
"Came for an authentic Cuban experience. The food was bland, fried with minimal sauce. The staff was friendly and the mojito gave me a quick buzz, but I would not return.",0
The worst service I have ever had and we were the only people in there! Chicken was burnt and had to scream at the waitress to ask her to fix it!!!! Could not pay me to go back!!!!,0
"Every time my boyfriend and I eat here, it has been great. We really enjoy the steamed dumplings and hot and sour soup. The staff is very friendly, too.",0
Had an awesome breakfast burrito this morning. A lot for your money. Better than the Filibertos across the street & cheaper. Love their Cali burrito!,0
"Blue berry hill is an awesome restaurant, I really enjoyed their chorizo skillet! Their staff was also awesome! We did come in a group of 20 and I can imagine how hard that maybe to keep a family of 20 happy.",0
"This place was \""OK,\"" but I probably wouldn't go back. Food was kind of low end Chinese although service and atmosphere were fine. Not really bad, just not good either.",0
This location is CLOSED. \n\nYou can find them on the NW corner of Dobson & Baseline in Mesa now.,0
Don't ever buy s costume here.   My wife bought a costume and tried to return it 3 hours later and they wouldn't take it.,0
"Beautiful rooms, excellent meeting spaces. The beds are like clouds and the double shower head in the bathroom was amazing. \n\nHowever, the customer service lacks excellence and the WiFi is completely unreliable.",0
"Awesome!  We ate here several times and everything was very good.  Good service, clean place, and the noodles...",0
Getting charged for ranch when it comes with your meal is ridiculous. Who orders chicken strip dry? Also the people there are rude.,0
"Wow...everytime i go to Vegas i always stop by to this place. Their food is tremendous and excellent. So yummy especially their Krispy Pata and bbq. Most of all, d service is really good.",0
Both the burger and the pork belly are excellent. Definitely worth the wait!,0
By far the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. The Kool-aid in a mason jar and fried pickles appetizer really made it a unique and tasty dinner.,0
Yum!  Great fresh baked goods in the Fitchburg hood.,0
"Nice place. Pricy for being in a mall, and the waitress never let us know about any specials.",0
This is a wonderful place with excellent food reasonably priced. A ton of TVs and quick service. Wish I'd found it earlier.  Excellent burgers and amazing mac and cheese (add the diced chilis!),0
"Although they are known for their adorable cookies, I am not a huge fan. Whenever I have ordered from them, the service has not been great and my pastries are usually dry and not that tasty.",0
I had the spinach dip and it was not good at all. Followed by the Turkey Pesto sandwich. That was just OK. That atmosphere was great though a very cute place.,0
LOVE this place!  GREAT service everytime!,0
Food was great and was a nice change from the standard Mexican joint. Atmosphere was kinda like a cafeteria and lighting was way too bright. That said the food was a solid 3.5 stars. Atmosphere 2 with an average of 3.,0
"To save money, I took my Mini Cooper for an oil change here but you have to bring your own filter, drain plug and filter removal tool. The techs were very friendly too.",0
Had a nice dinner here. I had filet mignon and it was awesome! Very good steak. But my husband had the ribeye and wasn't too impressed with it. But all together we were satisfied!,0
"An oddly bright and open bar for Old Town on a Saturday night, but it's pretty much a staple. Gilligin's is a good place for groups and enoying the patio.",0
"The best sushi In town, cockers are real Japanese and the quality of the fish is super",0
"Their Viva Las Vegas Roll is always good, but the service always leaves you with a bittersweet taste. \nWe don't plan on going back!!",0
Fun little hole in the wall. Back behind the Starbucks at 16th and Bethany Home Rd.,0
We purchased some trees that soon died from spider mites and they were not interested in our problem.,0
Hard to tell which was colder: my beer or my burrito. The service was non-existent. And had to beg for chips and salsa. Skip this one.,0
The food was excellent! I haven't had better sushi than this. The primo is my new favorite roll.,0
Too busy to place a take out order is what i was told by an employee. Update your website and indicate that take out orders are not available. Im glad Ihop was available to take my order,0
Average food. The waitress was pretty rude and gave us problems with the Groupon we had.,0
"We paid the \""twilight rate\"" of $29 but after 4 holes in two hours, the pro shop said we should be able to play 9. Really?  I'll be supporting a different course come May thru Sept.",0
"I wouldn't pay attention to the Trib's news coverage, since it's mostly far-right propaganda. Two stars for their decent sports coverage - Mike Prisuta and Joe Starkey are worth reading.",0
The food is average and the service is TERRIBLE! The manager does nothing to rectify the situation.,0
"My favorite coffee place. The staff are awesome and the atmosphere is great too! Free wi-fi, lots of places to sit and great drinks!!",0
The bubble/boba tea was absolutely disgusting.,0
"Another popular coffee spot. Always busy, parking can be a problem since there are several business sharing the strip mall. \nFriendly staff and prompt service.",0
"Just the place I was looking for!. Authentic Mexican, big portions, delicious!",0
Have been twice in past two weeks. Chicken enchiladas were good. Carnitas and Chili Verde were fantastic. Loved the chips and salsa. Some of the best I have had in quite awhile. Will be returning.,0
Put it simple....Big warehouse for pets. Awsome deals. Huge selection. YOU HAVE GOT TO CHECK THIS PLACE OUT.,0
HELLO BIRTHDAY CAKE ICECREAM! I was with some fellow Carnegie Mellon alum and they swore that I needed to get the Birthday Cake. I am not one to be craving ice cream but it was so good.,0
"This place is under new management and is awesome!!  If you enjoy socializing with your friends, bring them here and bowl, drink, etc. -- its very nice and a ton of fun!",0
"Super friendly staff, amazing milk shakes, and one of the best burgers I've ever tasted in my life. \n\nOh and it's cheap, too.",0
"I was there for an hour, in between flights.  It has bathrooms, planes, overpriced food and gift stores, and is moderately clean and well tended.",0
Love their corned beef and cabbage on wed. nights.,0
5-stars for the breakfast sandwich and proximity to the Sheraton Four Points. \n\na fine place with nice checkers!,0
Are you kidding? The food was below average and overpriced and there were flies buzzing around the salsa bar.  You have got to go to Carolina's on Cactus Rd. and Cave Creek.,0
Canned peas and carrots in shrimp with lobster sauce.  Service was friendly but it couldn't overcome what was quite possibly the worst Chinese food I've ever had.,0
"They don't even tell you that it's your responsibility to take a bag of chips with your take out order, so people walk out all the time paying for chips they don't get? No more of this place.",0
I know this is a brewery but no air conditioning in the summer in Arizona? The bear was good the service was okay and the atmosphere was hot as hell and I would never go back there in the summer.,0
I like their pho. I like their expansive menu. I usually get vermicelli dishes here. And they're pretty good.,0
"Superb service and reliably fine food from this family owned restaurant. Briskly busy at lunchtime, relaxed at night, always comfortable. A pleasure!",0
Did a good job of cleaning but definitely missed a couple of spots that I'm paying for (air vent louvers). Looked to upsell me right away to something that didn't make any sense.,0
"The Cafe in the Palace Station has the most enormous, delicious sandwiches and burgers.",0
Yummy Chinese food.  I love the eggplant dish.  Good for dining in or take-out.,0
"A couple notches below a waffle house, dry potatoes, dry bacon, eggs were good. Pancake pretty standard, friendly staff.",0
HIGHLY disappointed! Far too overpriced & its crappy as hell. Even the quality of their wings was worthless. Will NOT be coming back,0
"Amazing, amazing, amazing. I love their cucumber salad, their tempura is delicious without being soggy, the bento combos are adorable and overflowing with food.. and oh yeah, the sushi is AMAZING.",0
"LOVE IT! \nWe are regulars here and enjoy our sushi! Always consistent, great staff, good prices (matters when you go every week!)",0
"I love this place!  The food is consistently good and fresh!  We order out most of the time for convenience, but have eaten in the restaurant and have always had wonderful service.  Excellent!!",0
"Food is good, however every time I've gone the staff makes me feel like I'm putting them out by being there.",0
"Its the Ritz, can they do anything wrong?",0
The staff is very attentive and the atmosphere is welcoming. We also enjoy bringing out of town guest here because the menu has something for everyone.,0
I was banned for life from this bar in the Spring of 2006.,0
I am thinking people are writing reviews for the atmosphere and not the food.  The food is not good.  You go for the adventure of it but not the food.,0
Happy hour meatballs before the game.  Add a beer and it's all good.,0
I think this place is OK. I believe most people who like it are new to vegitarian-vegan items.,0
These guys who run this aren't honest but their employees are honest hard workers.,0
"Love this place, food and ice cream not to expensive but not to cheap. Will go back for sure. Not much else to say, sandwiches ice cream not a lot of variety.",0
Ignored the reviews here. Went anyway. Now I regret it.,0
Average lamps store.  It is a good place for purchasing lamps.  Slightly expensive at times.,0
Only had a take out but still had a great experience. The host was very good and funny!! The food was great too!,0
"I really enjoy myself here. The food, the staff and the prices are all good. I do have to admit that I have only had the pizza though. They have a nice sized crowd every time I am there.",0
"These ladies really know what they are doing and the service is AWESOME. I went there and they were very friendly, fast and professional if you need any tailor services you will not be disappointed by Elegant Reflections... Thank You",0
I had so much fun! Very nice people and the trail was so peaceful. I would defiantly go again.,0
"great, family owned place that feels like the kind of italian joint that is made with love. \n\nFood options are very good with traditional italian dishes and unique entrees that can't be found elsewhere.",0
Menu is rather small soft serve is So so prices are reasonable. Service not very friendly. Very small interior with limited seating. If your In the area I would opt for Page dairy mart instead.,0
Amazing tour with a guide that was very knowledgeable and entertaining. The prize of the 90 Minute tour was a bit steep but well worth it after the fact. I will be back for the shelter tour.,0
"A basic Starbucks. Nothing too flashy, but it's always clean and the baristas are friendly. It's usually totally packed so it's pretty noisy, but the line moves fast. Great location.",0
The buffet is mid level cafeteria food. That's all I have to say about that.,0
"Seriously good food, and great service!  Very authentic,  and they made stuff for our group that wasn't even on the menu!",0
"Best fast food Mexican place around. food is freshly cooked, inexpensive and delicious. Beats Robertos for sure. Not a fancy place but if you want excellent Mexican food, this is the place to go!",0
The staff is friendly and quick to make the food. But as far as the food goes it's not worth the money. The bread is very thin and hard and the sandwiches are very plain and lacking in flavor.,0
Great in and out!  I have been to a few airports but this is well set up.,0
"Enjoyed the lunch but service is slow. Glad to see an updated menu, wish dinner was offered.",0
Not a great airport. It is chronically crowded and doesn't manage this well. I try to avoid this airport when possible.,0
"This was a surprisingly great find - the menu had plent of options, the service was outstanding with wonderful recommendations (definitely trust the waitress), and from appetizer to dessert, just a wonderful experience.",0
"We used to go here for our Americanized Chinese food every so often for the last 7 years.  However, in the last year the quality of their food has taken a nose dive to unacceptable levels of blech and blah.",0
Nice convenient coffee and sandwich shop. The food is good and prices are reasonable. Staff is friendly. Only draw back is it gets pretty crowded at lunch so lines can be long.,0
"The service was good, the food, not so much. went because we had a Groupon, won't be back.",0
Great service today replacing my husbands watch battery and removing links from the watchband.  Nice folks.,0
"Ever since Dominos changed up their recipe/ingredients, their pizza has really been awesome. I enjoy the thin crust with spinach, tomatoes, and mushrooms.  Mmmm",0
I went here for a groupon and got suckered into upgrading services. I was not impressed with the services and should have just stuck with the regular car wash.,0
Very good massage friendly staff good people. I recommend it. Not the best I've had but not bad at all,0
"Won't go back, local vibe, bad music, slow service",0
"I love this Rock Bottom location, especially eating out on the patio during the cooler spring and fall months.  I'm shocked that they've closed.  What a bummer!",0
I don't understand the hype for this place. Service was ok and my filet mignon was SO overcooked and lacked flavor. The only decent part about my meal was the molten chocolate cake. Will not come back.,0
"EXCELLENT, you really get the taste of Vietnam here",0
"Awful everything. From the bad service, to the diluted soup, to the lame-no chicken on the chicken salad, to the PRE-fabricated pizza. AVOID THIS PLACE!",0
Nice retaurant in AZ...Nice selection and very authentic. I definitely recomend this place if you are in Phoenix area.,0
"For me, the pho was nasty.  The chicken was disturbing.",0
The food was excellent with large portions. I ate most of the banana pancake by myself. My Husband enjoyed the skillet as well. The waiter was super friendly!,0
The wings here are fantastic and the cheese sticks are absurd in a very good way. Will definitely be back.,0
Thank you Dr. Pagani for the great care you provided my son. You made a painful accident....Positive with your personal care and professionalism. You're simply wonderful. :)))),0
"Solid food, large selection, and a cozy, warm ambiance. A nice place for a family dinner or lunch to catch up with a friend.",0
"Had the lunch 2fer combo, turkey sandwich and pecan salad. Both were amazing. I added on a cup of tomato bisque that I used for dipping the sandwich in. Delish!\n\n (:",0
Ok I can eat here and be full but nothing to write home about......,0
An absolutely delicious brunch with honest food and eager to please staff. Youll definitely see me again.,0
its convenient being downtown but the pharmacy itself literally closes at 5pm everyday and the prices are at least $2-3 more than a regular walgreens that you would find elsewhere.,0
The tools are cheap but sometimes that's all you need. The people here are nice and fairly helpful. I would go back.,0
"Very friendly and helpful,knowledgable and not tryin to charge us more than they should plus he gave us 15% off!",0
"Always friendly. Been coming to do my eyebrows and nails for years now. Everyone does a great job. We all know how hard it is to find a good eyebrow person, Lynn is the best! She always has people waiting for her.",0
"Hmmmm, well the food was okay. the service was okay. the atmosphere was just okay. \n\nThat sums it up.",0
"this mimis has gone way down hill, acouple managment changes really hasnt helped much",0
"Low quality food! and as far as drinks, I ordered Ecstasy martini and I couldn't even drink it. It tasted really weird and I had to send it back. One good point though was they took that out of my bill.",0
"Always a great place to fall back on! Really love the carrot raisin muffins, omelettes, and french onion soup!",0
Stay away!!!!!! The waiters/waitresses hate you and your hapiness.,0
"Great beer selection but that's about it. Sketchy crowd, dungeon-like lighting and weird music selection.",0
Our waiter was great but I'm sorry but I don't like hearing the manager yell at his employees right near our table. The food is sub par. I could have a better salad at super salad.,0
The young lady at the front desk was very professional to all customers even though some customers were not.  Incident taken on this date at 18:32 hours.,0
"Terrible food. Were the steak tacos supposed to be purely made of steak fat? To top it off, got charged for a beer that I took two sips of and sent back. Will not be going back.",0
I've been using Sherrys for over 6 years and they are always available by phone to set an appt in advance or at last minute.,0
"I love this place but very disappointed they took their best sandwich, the pizza grinder, off the menu.  I guess I won't be going here as much now.",0
Its clean its fast its good food that wont break the bank :),0
"Superb neighborhood deli!  Delicious quality food, great value, fast friendly service!",0
This spot is a must stop for anyone looking for delectable dishes in the Vegas area that are off the strip. They have previously won the best of Vegas award and continue to achieve that same standard.,0
"Love everything I've had here. If you are looking for a yummy sandwich, this is the spot!",0
I go to this gym 4-5 times a week. place is always clean and the owner is hands on. If a machine is broken or cable needs to be fixed it is always taken care of quickly.,0
I always come here to buy the TDK DVD-R 100pk when they are on sale. This week they are only $17.99. \n\nThe staff is always friendly and helpful every time I shop here.,0
Very good chicken fried steak. Okra. And mashed potatoes. Makes great leftovers if you can't finish!,0

"Went with wife and two kids for dinner.  We had a great time. The food was delicious, service was great and ambiance just right.  Go here!  You will not be disappointed",0
"Nice hotel, front desk could be more helpful. Not many perks for the price. Rooms very clean and spacious. Beautiful building. Very very close to Consol energy",0
We ordered a mixed plate and saimin. Portions are pretty generous.  Will come back again.,0
"Excellent food. Very clean restaurant. Very friendly staff. What more could you ask for! The mint chutney is genuine, no some green liquid. I had the butter chicken extra hot. The spice level was perfect! Definitely recommended.",0
"This place is great! I hate going to the dentist but they make it very comfortable - the staff is terrific, organized and the establishment is very clean, (and tastefully decorated!).",0
Went for lunch and was very disappointed. Restaurant smells musty and the food was awful. Service was very good.,0
"I always order their Kimchi fried rice. The beef bowl isn't too bad either. I just wish their sushi roll portions were a bit bigger. They are good though. Oh and if you love sweet, order thier Honeytoast!",0
Solid 3 1/2 stars.  Sashimi was super fresh.  All the cooked foods were not bad either.,0
"Terrible service. Food was mediocre, deserts were inedible.",0
Was in Vegas for the weekend. Ordered pizza for delivery & it never showed up.,0
"Not bad.  Not much to choose from in Wilkinsburg, so I would have to call this the best in town.",0
I was told by the intake person If you are trying to schedule an appointment and have ever been in an automobile accident AT ALL IN YOUR LIFE they will not see you. With all of the skilled doctors they supposedly have--whats the point?,0
"1st visit was okay.\n\n2nd time I tried the \""Spicy Hunan with Tofu\"", and it was probably the best  chinese with the perfect spice ratio.\n\nYummy!",0
"Any place that plays Sunshine Day by the Brady Bunch is okay in my book. Oh, and being greeted by a big ol' cock as soon as ya walk in a place... even better!",0
"Pasta, pasta, pasta... Yes, please! \nI love their spaghetti and meatballs. Go there during happy hour and you will not be disappointed. It was a little warm in the bar area.",0
"best boba i have tasted in town! hate the wait and the service, but love the boba!",0
The hamburgers are delicious the service was great the malts are the best,0
Prices are way too high for the type of service you receive.. I live in Los Angeles and pay less than the $27 that this salon charged for a mani pedi...,0
"Amazing place, great food, better service. Melinda always takes care of me and offers great customer service! Even the fried rice is exceptional here! :)",0
"I love this place. They have such great food, i leave satisfied every visit.\nThe foods delish, the staff is friendly, and the decor is awesome. \nCould eat there everyday  :)",0
"Overpriced, usually burnt, tasteless, if you're spending this much money on these bad burgers you might as well just go to Blue Plate a mile or two down atwood and get something worth your time.",0
"I only stopped here for a case of beer since I drove by it... usually I prefer Total Wine.  I will give Lee's that they have more locations, but it's not as good of a selection or price as Total Wine.",0
We tried the prime rib tonight. Very Yummy.,0
"Not so bad, and definitely not traditional bar food. That said, we opt for better food in the downtown area.",0
"This restaurant is very great to din in. Reddish cake, sticky rice on lotus leaf, yaw choi are great appetizers! Wonton noodles is tasty too. Not pricy.",0
Not only was the food wonderful but the staff are friendly.  The ribs are sooooo tender and the red beans & rice are fabulous.  The cornbread is YummmmmY.,0
"Area kinda shady...but best fried chicken in the city by far. Great prices also, I always recommend it to anyone who ask about chicken or soul food.",0
"Been coming here for 7 years. It's good, not fancy, and perfect for \""comfort\"" Chinese food.",0
"Went there for the first time today and I will definitely be going back, Rose did my nails and she is great, she takes her time and really cares. Best manicure I have ever had.\n\n-Kim",0
"Unless this place is under new management, this is a very dirty place.",0
"Love this place!!!! Great food, great atmosphere!!",0
If your in the hotel or casino and looking for a decent meal than this will do. Food is okay just typical buffet food at a decent price.,0
"This location is fairly small. However, it still has a pretty decent variety of beers.",0
Tasty donuts in a convenient location. I've had their coffee rolls and other regular donuts and all of them are good.,0
only pizza delivery in my area. It's hit or miss but it gets the job done.,0
I sure needed an easy button on this trip.,0
"Your standard sports bar fare, reasonably priced and served with a smile.  Good for a beer and a sandwich while watching a game.",0
"LOVE it! MUCH better than some of the CU alternatives when it comes to Indian food. \nI recommend the saag paneer, and they have DELICIOUS naan.",0
Free tortilla chips and salsa are the best part. The margaritas are about average and the enchilladas are ok. The price is right and the decor is good but I've had better.,0
this place is the gambling mecca for the asian peps out there is was crazy walked in here and did not see one whitey.,0
Good food.....good beer! And great pumpkin spice beer (if you get it while it's in season). My only complaint it's that it gets hot  inside in the summer.,0
"This is a good place to sit back and relax. Overlooking mill avenue, you can sit on the 2nd floor patio and enjoy a cold beer and some tasty garlic fries either on a visit to Tempe or after work and class.",0
Great service. Love the place and Ricky is awesome. Very professional..he's the best!,0
Try the 28 special. You won't be disappointed,0
"What a disappointment.  Terrible service, no bread until requested three times, bland unseasoned food and 16 bucks for a salad. Pass on this place. Only the valet was worthwhile.",0
Chili was awesome... Good toppings bar but nothing out of the ordinary. Burger was moist & well cooked but without seasoning. Great chocolate shakes!,0
I went here once when I first moved to Pittsburgh. My shirts came back poorly pressed and some had broken buttons. I was disappointed.,0
"The chicken tastes blandfully artificial, but what should one expect from Subway anyway?",0
for breakfast or lunch this is the place to menu is very extensive for a smaller place and food is awesome,0
"This place is not what it once was. it is a shell of its self, with outsourced beer production, canned food, and bad service. Sorry to be so negative, it has earned it however.",0
Expensive. Pedicure was about 15 minutes. I had to actually ask to get my cuticles cut. Won't go back,0
"Very friendly & helpful staff, they carry specialty dog food at great prices. Love coming here for my fur kids! They also offer low cost vaccine clinics on saturdays",0
Nice neighborhood bar.  Food is very ok and certainly is not made by hand.  Nice beer selection.  Many TV's.,0
"Cool set up! We liked the feel of the place. The food was good, but I guess we were hoping for really good. We would return but only if we were in the area.",0
"Penguin is a cool spot. The fried pickles are good as sh?t, the burgers are good also. Good luck finding a seat though.",0
"Great curry, beef salad and noodle dishes.  Not as spicy as first time I came here but they have ground flakes on the table along with soy and fish sauce.  Always enjoy eating here when I'm on this end of town.",0
"The friendly baristas keep their cool even when the line is out the door, which it frequently is! Lots of regulars and their dogs hanging outside on the weekends when the weather is nice!",0
Smells like a public restroom in the diner. Avoid at all costs!!!,0
This is the cheapest hangout out there. The drinks are decent and the service is ok. Will come back.,0
"Huge fan of the 8pm yoga classes during the week. The 11am class on Sunday should be labeled as Power Yoga, it is not a traditional yoga class and is really intense.",0
"We go to Sakana on a regular basis. We usually only order sushi. For the price, location, and quality and quantity of the sushi, we really like Sakana.",0
I had the Carnitas burrito. It was hands-down the worst Carnitas burrito I've ever had in my life.\nMaybe everything else tastes pretty good but that was disgusting.,0
Good salad bar. The rest of the menu is just OK. Rouben and the courier burger are among their best.,0
This used to be a fav but last few experiences both food and service have been terrible. Will miss this place after being a dedicated patron for 15 years.,0
There is only about 4 pieces of meat about the size of my thumbnail in my Hakata bowl. So disappointing.,0
Great healthy fast food and really happy with music in dining room and the beautiful service people working here at the border,0
Have seen a few shows here and am always impressed by the acoustics. The American Soul and Rock-and-Roll Choir played last night and were excellent.,0
The pizza I order is always delicious and always ontime.,0
Bring a book to read while you wait for your food to come. A pillow might come in handy also.,0
Some of the worst food I have ever had I would never recomend this to anyone.  Go to Sakana or Hiro Sushi,0
"Very quaint! Stopped here for lunch while traveling for work, and I felt like I was in a diner in the 1950s. Had a grilled cheese and fries - the food was good and everyone was friendly.",0
"Large resort in the desert. Great pool area, with the chairs that have flags to raise to get service. Plus it's pet friendly.",0
"The maple bacon doughnut was tasty, but the cherry fritter blew. my. mind. My iced coffee was decent as well. I anticipate returning to rainbow doughnuts!",0
"Wonderful fleet of aircraft! As an experienced pilot, they have the right tools for the job. Wonderful staff and owners. Highly recommended!",0
Very welcoming staff with great service. The refried beans here are among the very best restaurant beans I have ever had. The chili rellenos are good. Overall very satisfied and will be back.,0
"Cheap sushi, but not very good. The rolls fell apart and the wasabi was really low quality. I also found a tiny mite in my ginger.",0
They make smoothies.  Can a smoothie ever be bad?,0
een coming here for years and it's still my favorite place to get some oysters.\nEnjoy some clams strips and beers out on the patio. Great atmosphere!,0
"This place has shockingly expensive drinks for an establishment that looks divey. That's why no one ever goes here. I'm not sure how they stay in business, but God bless them.",0
"The food was great, but the service was absolutely terrible. I think it took nearly 90 minutes for dinner for 2 people. It's a great choice when Lotus of Siam has a long wait, but be prepared for spotty service.",0
Waited 10 minutes to be seated at a time with plenty of open tables.  It's now 25 minutes after I ordered and still no food. Last time for this guy!,0
"Got a bag of many different pastries.  Every single one of them was stale, barely edible.  Super disappointing since a few years ago this place was a solid 4.",0
"Good food and good service. We ate there on Christmas Day at dinner time while traveling. The servers were cheerful, friendly, and efficient even after being there many hours. I would definitely go there again if we are in the area.",0
"it has variety of seafood, but most of which is very old..",0
"Old Country Buffet is above average as far as American buffets go. If you're in the mood for it, it's pretty tasty.",0
"I took my two a bit difficult German shepherds in for a bath and nails and they did a great job. They also said my dogs behaved well. I'm sure they lied, but it made me feel good.",0
easy to drop off ink cartridge for recycling but they don't offer battery recycling. kind of a bummer.,0
I am strictly a tea drinker...and the choices here are lacking..but the atmosphere more than makes up for the poor tea selection.,0
"Expensive, slow, but good food if you don't mind the wait or check.",0
"Great hotel. Good service, Great shuttle service.",0
"The manager, Michael is not a people person. No personality what so ever. The rooms suck.",0
I ordered a large pepperoni pan pizza togo. I normally like pizza hut but for some  reason the pizza seemed way to greasy and didn't taste that great. In fact I got naseous after eating 2 slices.,0
"Great service, open late till 9pm. Good warranties.",0
They had really great pizza! It was also big enough for 2 to share,0
The food is reminiscent of a hospital cafeteria. The staff is rude and the ambiance is tacky.,0
"My wife recently had some pain in her lower back and called American Chiropractic Center.  The staff was friendly, fast and took care of her problem.  Excellent chiropractor!",0
Love this place!! This place is fast and easy to get food from. They are open late and early. Their pricing is super affordable and the food is delicious!!,0
"The atmosphere outside on the patio is nice, but the food wasn't more than mediocre at best. Good service.",0
I will never return here. Went to grab pizzas on the go and the manager ruined my experience. She was rude and made me feel like we troubled her ordering pizzas.,0
"We actually came to this place because of its reviews on yelp.. We were not disappointed.. Good food, friendly service and best of all good value..",0
"Food and service was pretty good. The margaritas were a very good deal, but on the weak side. I will go there again!",0
"Great little cosmetics shop with many different brands. I love that you can pick scents and customize your own lotions, etc.\n\nAlways a definite stop for me when Im in Madison.",0
Food good. Service mediocre at best... 10 workers three customers and no greeting at all... Made me feel like I was bothering him...,0
My bud and I have enjoyed the table for years. We had breakfast there today and whatever they have done to their corn beef hash is disappointing and one of the worst breakfast mealsI have ever had. The service is slow and unorganized.,0
I was really looking forward to this place. The beans and Mac n Cheese were great. The meats were dry and tasteless.  The service was very friendly and the prices were fair,0
"Generic, flavorless food. Don't let the open kitchen fool you; this is Panda Express without the cafeteria style line. Disappointed and won't be returning.",0
The food was good but I went through the drive thru and my order was completely wrong.  Way bigger order than what I got so it worked out.  I would go back,0
"Not a great dining experience. Adequate service, but food is just ok. Definitely didn't love it.",0
"The fries and 'slaw piled into all of the sandwiches is a cool local niche, but I'd say the overall quality of the sandwiches are just average otherwise.",0
This store lost a customer. After the manager disrespected my role as customer I no longer will be ordering from this particular store.,0
"Great Food, Great Service. Better for Date Night than dinner with 5 Kids. Not Kid \""unfriendly\"" just not kid friendly if you get my drift. Oh, did I mention they have GREAT FOOD?",0
"The people are friendly and took great care of my \""boys\"".  I also use their grooming services and am very happy with the results.",0
"The food is bland which I guess is to be expected since it is English.  However, it was substance and not exspensive.",0
The worst customer service I have experienced in my life. How is it possible you are even in business?,0
"They are good. They produce your standard west coast doughnut. The flavor is solid, selection is good and the fritter, my bench mark, is well made. Over all 3 stars for being average compared to the others I have tried",0
They did not do well. They totally screwed my order up and then just seemed indifferent to it. \nI should have known better.,0
Avg filipino fast food. I grew up eating real filipino so the food is ok when u want something really quick and you dont want to cook urself,0
All I have ever sampled here is the croissants and they are a buttery delight and butter is not cheap and neither are the croissants but well worth the treat. Enjoy,0
"A must try, Chicken is great. I have never had this combo before, but will say it was better then I thought",0
Cool local bar vibe but the burger left me wanting more! I love the well seasoned grill in the window and the bar itself! Shoulda stayed in Sauk City for lunch today (in my opinion),0
Menu changed and the food is horrible and horribly overpriced. They are trying to go with a French flair and failed. DO NOT GO HERE. Gross!!,0
"Don't get kids meal with chicken nuggets!! Gross!! The workers are not friendly and the chicken you can plainly see are pre cooked in uncovered, undated containers in their cooler!!",0
"Always have a good time when we go here, gets freakin' busy during Happy Hours! HUGE selection of TV's! sooo many you dont know what to watch!",0
"Everything is super fresh whenever we go. Easy to fill a plate with healthy, delicious salad, but hard not to overheat! Their chili is also very tasty. We always try to eat there when we are in Phoenix.",0
friendly and fast! but they are in need of a remodel.,0
Lots of factory made crap here. Also tried to refuse a plastic bag but the lady just had to give me one.,0
The food was good but the chef did not speak the whole time while cooking. I am not sure if it was his first day :\\,0
I love this place! Staff is great very knowledgeable every cut of meat i have ever gotten has been top quality. Oh and did i mention the twice baked potatoes?!,0
"Absolute GARBAGE! The service sucks, the food wouldn't interest you dog, and the place is a mess. I won't be back",0
"A \""neighborhood joint\"" that's closed on Sundays during football season???",0
The pork egg foo young was fantastic and the service is quick and friendly a must try again.,0
Terrible car wash!!! Avoid at all cost!!! Put a dent in my car and won't take responsibility. Worst car wash ever.,0
"Meatball sub horrible,little rocks of meat? Never again",0
"I really enjoyed the set-up of the restaurant. The side room looks very authentic. The staff are nice enough, although the service isn't exactly prompt and polite. Great food!",0
"I brought a pepperoni pie home from Pat's once and it was completely forgettable. The sauce was average and, like the cheese, not plentiful enough. It wasn't any better cold the next day.",0
"Simple American food, fairly well done. Pleasing atmosphere and friendly staff, reasonable prices.",0
"Maybe I'm a Mexican-food snob, but this was basically overpriced-Del Taco fare.\nThe food was nothing to write home about. It was served on Styrofoam plates and the customer service was lacking.",0
I would say that this is the best Hawaiian restaurant.  Reasonable price and prompt service.  Portions are massive.  Too massive.,0
"Went for lunch. Food tasted fine. Portions were small and WAY overpriced. Terrible service...servers were inattentive and indifferent, the manager bordered on rude. Will never return.",0
It's staff is better than the Orchid. The food is an array of dim sum.\nThe decor is typical. The quality is okay.,0
"Meh. I hate how this store is laid out, and everything is tackily displayed. I also hate how they gouge you for printer ink. Huge store, not much going on inside. Too bad it's so close.",0
have been taking our almost 6-year old to Plantation since the day we brought her home from the Humane Society 5 1/2 years ago.  Couldn't ask for better treatment or friendly folks.,0
Never had a problem with McCarran Airport.  I've traveled in and out of this location a number of times over the past several years and had good experiences each time.,0
"This is the BEST breakfast place in Madison, nay, the world. Try the 49'er pancakes and you'll never go back to regular ones. \n\nMy family eats there every weekend!",0
Their breads are the best. I really like the BLT Plus as well as their seasonal sandwiches.,0
"If you like dog food, then go to this lousy place for food.",0
"Friendly, amazing family run Italian deli. Almost everything there is imported. Food is soo good, and the deli, well you can just never decide what to get!! Same amazing quality every time:)",0
"This place is absolutely amazing. The bean and cheese burrito, chicken nachos, and chicken salad is so good. Totally come to this place all the time :)",0
Was not impressed with my too oily & tasteless shrimp meal. I walked out wishing I went to Chili's.,0
"Theres nothing special about this place, just so-so chinese food you can grab on the fly. Its not terrible, but i wouldnt choose to come here if i had another choice.",0
I know good thai curry and this was far from it. Service was very good.,0
Decent pizza and calzones.  Get rid of the canned mushrooms! Crowded at lunch.  Calzones are huge!,0
"Having some sushi at Temari in Gilbert.  Sake is the owner, has a binder with new creations he thinks of on a daily basis.  I would highly recommend this place for great Sushi!!!!",0
"Just proving I'm not a foodie snob ;) well it's cheap, effective and comes with free packets of ketchup. Enjoy!",0
I love this place. I'm new to the world of decorating and Dee is so kind and helpful! So much to choose from. The only downside is that it's so far from my location.,0
Honest mechanic shop with great labor rates. I had the best experience.,0
The worst sub I ever had! The tuna was bad and the cold cuts are inferior! I was sick for 2 days!!! The board of health should check this place out!!!,0
"Not real impressed.  Sauce wasn't all that and sliced beef was tough. Trash can was full, restaurant wasn't real clean. Two small sandwiches and two sides came to $20.   Won't be back.",0
Starbucks carries a great reputation. LOVE STARBUCKS!,0
"Hands down the worst bar I've been to in Arizona. The place was filthy and full of only men. I went there with my sister and we were pretty uncomfortable, to say the least. Not my scene at all.",0
The only place I will buy alcohol in Madison. The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere of the store is unbeatable. They are always running super good deals on booze which is good if your on a budget.,0
"All station casinos are great in general but I like the Boulder because it's never super congested, the cafe has some of the best pastries, they have all kinds of bonuses and perks for gamblers and the staff are so friendly.",0
Ehhh I don't really like this place.,0
"We went for an early Sunday lunch, around 11 am. The food was excellent, delicious pastrami and very tasty matzoh ball soup. Only complaint was the service, we had to continuously ask for more coffee and water.",0
This is my girlfriend first  time here. We ordered the ham and cheese and bacon 6in it was very good. We will return.,0
"Worst Applebee's ever! Go to the one in Boca Park instead.  Terrible service! First time I've never left a tip. Yes, it was that bad!",0
I love their menu!  The garlic mashed potatoes-amazing!  Steak-melts in  your mouth!  Service - great!  Big fan of Applebee's!,0
Food is too salty. Salsa is good. I like that they have switched the service from ordering at a counter to sitting and ordering off a menu.,0
You get a free birthday drank if you sign up for it a bit ahead of your birthday! It's pretty awesome. But this is your average run of the mill Starbucks. Nothing special!,0
"The house soup and house salad were great. I didn't try the pasta which I think is good. Do NOT order \""Lobster&Shrimp Rivioli\"" because it tastes like microwave food.",0
"Lovely place in Las Vegas. Good option if, like me, you want to eat something else than american burgers. Hawaiian food is very good and this place is not expensive at all.",0
"great diner with good veggie and vegan options.\noverall very nice staff, friendly, prompt\ngreat desserts!",0
"Wonderful find and I am going again soon.  If you are tired of Vegas Strip food, then go to China Town.",0
We waited over an hour for a table. The hostesses were beyond rude. The food was ok but definitely not worth the wait. Don't waste your time!,0
I've been three times and the food has been great.  Seems no one knows how good this place really is.  Great undiscovered Italian food for locals.,0
Been here a couple of times and the only thing I've really liked is the spinach scone. It's not available every day but it's got just a kick of spice that makes it really yummy.,0
they make smaller tables wait longer to be sat and the food is not that great you can get better food at mid level steakhouse,0
You guys aren't going to get your money. I need to speak to a case manager as soon as possible.,0
At first glance and the area its in your like I am not going in there! but man what a surprise!! food was great and the staff was friendly. great place for lunch!,0
You CANNOT go to Vegas & not stop by this place.  It's as iconic of a place then any of the casinos.  Place is HUGE w/ anything you'd ever want.,0
Our favorite local Asian style food!  We have huge battles over the leftover Chow Mai Gun/ Singapore noodles.  Not cheap but a good value at lunch.   No delivery :(,0
"The times I've eaten here, the food was so-so. Meh.",0
"I have eaten almost everything on the menu at least twice I think.  Bloody Mary, hurricanes are well done and there is a good beer selection. High quality food in a relaxed setting.",0
The service was horrible and the slowest I've ever experienced. I won't be back.,0
Very good service and food. Very clean inside. Was greeted with a smile. Food came out hot and in a timely fashion.,0
Very friendly staff and my dog looked so cute when they finished! Great prices too. Highly recommend!,0
Far away from real Chinese food. Doesn't even taste good as American style Chinese food.,0
We ordered pizza today for lunch in our dental office.  The doctor was eating and a piece of glass was in the pizza.  They offered to return the money never did.  I don't recommend going to this store.,0
Best music shop in all of Arizona. An icon in downtown Mesa. They have thousands and thousands of instruments and offer affordable classes for aspiring musicians.,0
"Good Burger, and Great Service.\nThe Arizona Peach Ale is my favorite!",0
Oyster shooters in a plastic cup. Looked a little dirty. Shooters just tasted like ketchup.,0
"I wasn't all-too pleased with this restaurant. Their coleslaw was good, but their fish, scallops and shrimp came wayyy too overcooked for my taste. I won't be back anytime soon.",0
"the food itself is worth 4 stars, tasty toasted subs-parking is not the greatest but its worth the effort",0
Mystery Theater was cute and funny. Food was aweful and very bland.,0
"Charlotte needs more theatres with limited release movies.  Right now there is the Manor Twin, and this place.   Pretty old, but since I love indie movies, it's all I have :(",0
"After my bad service experience at Girasole, the manager apologized and compensated me for my troubles. I would definitely go back, considering that the unfortunate situation I encountered was out of the norm for this usually friendly, cozy restaurant.",0
Was Disaponinted with the amount of time it took me to get service at the bar!! Staff was friendly and the decar was nice.,0
"Oh yeah, this place absolutely blows. I'll enter in a new reason (though all mentioned are perfectly valid): Limited Clint Eastwood selections in the movie department. Fie!",0

"Great food, not great service when you have a Groupon.",0

Daniel is an asset to super cuts. I will request him for all future appointments.,0
"This location is great! There are never lines and the staff is always friendly. I did have an issue once, but the staff was super helpful in resolving it. It is WAY better than the extremely busy post office around the corner.",0
Amazing Pizza the Bar area is way too small and I was a big fan until I noticed the NO firearms sign really your restricting Law bidding citizens from entering your restaurant I havent been BACK,0
I love Noodles but this location is going downhill fast. They undercook/ overlook my chicken every time. They are also getting good at under boiling noodles!,0
"This place is GREAT! It is a GREAT place to impress your meat-eating friends! Tell them to get the buffalo wings, buffalo chicken sandwich, or mongolian chicken bowl... those are the best dishes!",0
The bed was exceptionally comfortable. I also loved that there was a Starbucks right outside the hotel. The gardens looked amazing!,0
"Burgers were great, you get free refils on fries.   Waiter was very friendly.   Only negative I could say is I ordered \""some pink\"" on my burger and it came out medium to medium well.",0
"I had the California tacos. The salsa was really good, but the tacos were sub-par. There are too many other good restaurants in the area to waste your time here.",0
Worst customer service I have ever received. The employees didn't stop talking to assist us. It was like we were interfering with their free time at work.,0
Just had the worst tasting greasy cheesburger I have ever had.  Served with about 5 french fries.,0
I like that they have Japanese bento style meals.,0
"Usually I really like this place but, on a Monday night with ONLY 1 person making the ice cream and 6 people in line..  Not good customer service Stone Cold..",0
"Great little all around burger stop. Great hotdogs burgers and Italian beef. They are across the street from my office, but often make the drive on Saturday just for lunch.",0
Seriously slow tall old man doesn't know how to make drinks.,0
"Fails Fargo,  keep your cash in your mattress!",0
"food is good, service is A+ and it was quick and easy to get across the river to the hockey game.",0
Its where all the action is!!! The best!!!,0
Great people. Everyone is very professional and helpful.,0
"Feels like your lost in a third world country, nothing but garbage.",0
The Room was way too small for my big ass...the casino was nice though.,0
Fired my pet from services but did it in a unprofessional and confrontational way that hurt my feelings.,0
It reminded me of the dirty restroom at the gas station on HWY 40 driving through Texas. Dirty and nasty.,0
What happened? It used to be so good! I think the Keirland location is better. The Vegas rolls seemed pre made and reheated. Service is hit or miss. The last server really slow when they weren't even busy.,0
"What a fantastic piece of Las Vegas History, Great informative tour of the history of the signs, Totally worth 15 bucks, and it goes to constructing the museum.. It is hot in the summer so bring sun tan lotion and a bottle!",0
"Personalized attention, zombie makeup advice, staff had detailed product knowledge.  A+ :)",0
"Great airport if you take away the slot machines or provide headphones for the gamblers. Free Wifi, clean bathrooms, and transportation to terminals is plenty. Good restaurants as well.",0
You could wander for hours in this mall.  Tons of great stores all under one roof.  Just don't forget where you parked!,0
Food was good bar food. Had the wings and the nachos. Service was horrible. The bartender had to pickup the slack for our worthless waitress.,0
"Very poor and non friendly service  Price are outrageous. I don't understand why people shop here unless the enjoy paying high prices and enjoy non friendly employees. But, I guess there is a store for everyone.",0
"Gas is decently priced but if you are a smoker, one of the best priced around.",0
"I don't like this pizza no flavor compared to Napolis, verrazano, due forni, or Rocco's",0
Decent food at decent prices.  I wasn't blown away by this place.  I was somewhat disappointed since I heard this is one of the better places in town to have breakfast - I have definitely had better elsewhere!,0
What a crap airport.  The airport security line is always backed up and they take forever to get your ticket scanned.  Hire more employees.,0
I have such fond memories of Orange Julius from when I was a kid.  And you know what they are still really really good. The only reason I gave them a four? It's kind of expensive!!!,0
This is one of the good dimsum places in Las Vegas.,0
I was in the drive thru about 10 minutes before they closed and the girl came over the speaker and said they were out of food and closed......ok,0
"Simple, not too far from town. Just watch out for slow moving people.",0
"Great place for bald guys to go. Horrible location, employees can barely speak English, and they have no talent to cut hair at all. Going to be wearing this horror show around for quite a few weeks.",0
All you can eat salad.  But I like my own dressing....there ranch. Just isn't right.,0
I love this place!! My mom and I have been faithful customers for about 3-4 years!! They treat us like family and their prices are better than any other nail salon :),0
Amazing food for the vegan or vegetarian. Pretty much everything on the menu is top notch.,0
Worst bar in the N. Phoenix! Get rid of your regulars and maybe you will see some real business! You need to clean up too! The place smells like you have bar rot!!,0
The McDonald's of Italian food. Need I say more?,0
Good service phad Thai so so at best Archis is way better,0
I paid $6.00 for an order of breaded mushrooms. There were 11 mushrooms when my order arrived. Total rip off and won't be repeating this mistake.,0
I don't mind the airport itself but the wait for baggage is ridiculous.  45 minute flight home from Vegas and 30+ minute wait on baggage. Insane!,0
"I love this resort, grounds are beautiful. I love the pool areas and the service is always amazing. They treat you like royalty here.",0
So glad we found this place! Everything is fresh and tastes just like we get when we are in Germany! Walked out with some fresh warm pretzels last week too!  This is our number one place for authentic German meat.,0
I really hate this airline. Sucks that aa merge with them. They are a bunch of rude flight attendant.,0
"My second home. Hands down, the ONLY place for swimmers in Charlotte.",0
Large selection of unique/cute-tastic gifts.  Humerous knick-knacks/books galore.  Very adorable and staff was very pleasant.  Looking forward to going back again.,0
Nice hotel. Went to it for a convention. Clean inside.,0
"When in Vegas gotta stop by this spot for adobo fried rice, open really late.",0
Nice place to go...I just moved here and had Jessica and Brenda do my services.  I would go back...they were busy!,0
Food is always great and the service is very attentive... We'll go back another day.,0
Excellent food the price is comparable especially on the creole dishes. You have to make reservations if you want to get a good seat otherwise come before six o'clock.,0
Terrible store lay out.  Clearly designed by a tired 3 year old with ADD,0
Just beautiful! Service is excellent rooms are beautiful. Food is great also! Thankyou! :),0
"Average Mexican restaurant.  I went there for lunch today.  The food was good, but nothing unique.",0
"Great place, great location, and for downtown EXCELLENT parking. The food was wonderful.  And despite the fact that every table seemed to be filled with holiday office parties, we were seated and served quickly.",0
It's a shame this place is closed. great staff and the place is clean too. I never have any complaints about this location.,0
"Wow,just left this place after a staycation at the Westin Kierland. Not only were the tubs very dirty but they did a horrible job. I will not go again........EWWW",0
"Stayed here 3 times in the last 3 months and it exceeded my expectations every time. Wish there was a 6 star button. Rooms are big, comfortable and quiet. Pool is awesome. All the staff goes above and beyond. Love it.",0
Best food I ate during my 5 day stay in Vegas by far.,0
"Actually, the service department showed me the price increase was due to labor cost increases, not oil. Nice try.",0
"Loved the atmosphere and great customer service, but the food was bland (at best) and the prices are too high.",0
"Last of a dieing breed, best old style fish and chips with a home made cocktail sause",0
Cheap but food tasted weird. Would not go back.,0
"Great service and the Toasted Blue Cheese Chips are a great appetizer. Lots of salads, pastas and burgers to choose from. We will definitely return.",0
"Called for delivery and was told they were closed though Yelp said they were open. Either they're wrong or Yelp is, in either case not the way to run a business.",0
"this place is hard to find, but when you get there it's worth it, had the link, brisket, rib combo, was great.",0
"After ihop shut down on campus, Perkins is an alternative for brunch. I ve never been here for lunch and dinner so far.",0
They made me pay before the food came it and added tip they did not earn forgot to out my order in I would NEVER come back. This is Vegas you give great service and earn your tip and don't mess up without fixing it.,0
"Coastal Trio was pretty good. Give it a try. Yum. $9.19 with tax.  Otherwise, prices are quite high for tacos and such. Must have a coupon to make it a good value.",0
"Nice waitresses. Fun place for old people,  food isn't special.",0
"A great, authentic, great tasting chinese restaurant. My favorite dish is the Salt & pepper pork chops. The mandarin pork chops are also really good. I have been coming here for 10 plus years. They are great for groups.",0
"Pretty good. Nice chips, good burrito. Haven't found any Wonderful mexican in Madison so far, but this is not bad.",0
One of the best Mediterranean restaurants in Madison. Nothing beats their kebabs!,0
Disgusting and overpriced tried the two most popular items on the menu honey walnut shrimp and salt and pepper pork chops and I couldn't eat past one bite.,0
"The actual croissants are good but only if you like plain ones. Very little filling in the sweet ones, and the breakfast ones are are frozen food tasting. Will not return!",0
This place is awesome!  Service and food is great!!,0
"They have all of the standard Mexican food options: tacos, burritos, enchiladas, tostadas, etc. But, for a counter service place, You can do better for yourself at several other places in town.",0
"This is about 2 steps up from IHOP. If you're looking for a quick breakfast place to hit outside of the typical weekend brunch hours, it could suffice, but definitely do not stick around if there's a wait.",0
The only good food I ever get are medium wings. I find that any Long Wong are the same and always enjoyed.   I have tried other items that I felt were poor.,0
"The bacon commercial with non stop fries, only says \""HEART ATTACK!!!!!\""   Thanks Applebee's",0
"Tuesday nights, free bacon and $1 beers! what more can you ask for?",0
"They always forget the hash brown and or the hot sauce for the breakfast burritos:/ I'm going to start checking my order every time I go here, can't trust them!",0
"We ordered two main dishes,it was like they double the salt for one and didn't put any for the other. They also forced a big tip without providing any service.",0
My vehicle was failed state inspection because of a claim I was missing specific emission equipment. So I went to the dealership to pickup the missing parts and the dealership informed me that my vehicle has never had the emissions parts in question.,0
Such a fun place!!! Food is delicious. Bottom line. Make sure to share sides so you get to try them all! Drinks are sugar filled in giant mason jars and chicken is juicy. Love the atmosphere and very worth the wait!,0
The staff is very friendly but I'm convinced that I'm getting ripped off and that the surgery performed on my dog was botched.  I'm still a customer though.,0
The hot and mild salsas were deeeeelish!! So much so that I had to buy a pint to take home.,0
"Their sandwiches just miss.\n\nThe pastrami, steak and turkey are plentiful, but flavorless.\n\nI have had better at other Capriotti's and certainly at other sandwich shops.",0
Great food and great choices. All taste fresh and they have something for every time of the day,0
"Food tastes alright but it's certainly not authentic. Dishes were drenched in sauce, egg rolls taste frozen. Only positive note is that it is a very clean establishment with polite service.",0
"Food was not so good, scallops very good, the sauce ok, calamaris were spicy, mushroom was spicy too, overall pricey and small portions, the place is ok the server was GREAT!",0
"Great food and the service is always GREAT, however it is a bit pricey. Maybe not the best place for kids",0
Just had a carne asada burrito. It was ready in about a minute and was awesome!,0
I once saw a puppy run from the kitchen into the side area. I asked the waitress about it and she said it was her daughters pet.,0
The service sucks. The food is ok. Don't let the good ambience of the place fool you. The only good thing is the chips and salsa.,0
I came in for motor oil and spark plugs and learned 3 different languages and may have contracted the Eboli while there.,0
Don't know about the nightlife scene here (anymore) but you really can't beat their happy hour. Its the good 'ol 2-for-1 cocktails and free food until 7pm! Can't beat that.,0
The best I've had in Vegas as we all know Vegas Isn't known for bread LOL,0
The new vegan menu at the Bread Co. is delicious. The linguine is especially hearty and chock full of veggies. The carrot cake was delicious as well.,0
The shaved ice is just a vehicle for artificially-flavored sugar. It's not very good.,0
Salad bar looked like it has been sitting there for hours especially the potato salad. Food let's just say... Not coming back to this one.,0
"The facility is very nice and clean and all the staff is so very nice, this is my favorite hospital in las Vegas",0
"Called for a cab and the driver that called was at the wrong location. Called back, told someone was on the way, 30 minutes and nothing. Complete waste of time and would never call back.",0
"Great experience at Chicago Hamburger Co.  Great service, great ambience and excellent food. 2/3 lb burger and Cheese fries are great!",0
Buyer beware if your gambling at the bar and you're winning your drinks are not free. Plus I order dinner as well so what I'm saying is the server should warn you that the drinks are not free. I will never go back,0
"A huge Albertson's.  A bakery, deli, prepared foods, Starbuck's and floral.  It is gigantic inside.",0
So big and filling. A great place for a great burger.,0
"Check out the 1929 Steinway self playing piano. One of two in the world, the other is in the Smithsonian. The piano is valued at 28 million dollars and was willed to the Wrigley Mansion",0
Good Gas Station Location. It's near Interstate Hwy 17 and close to Anthem factory Outlets.,0
Consistently good food and service..\n\nGood food and service.,0
Thad did a really good job on my heart tattoo.  The place is kind of old and dingy but the work area environment was sterile.\nI would defiantly let Thad do another tattoo for me.,0
"nothing to rave about this place.\nservice was poor and the food was bad.\nI know, I shouldn't expect much on cajun food in phoenix. but I'm always up for an adventure.",0
"Food is good, but the service line is super slow.  If it's a busy night, you will wait a while.",0
Clean location but be prepared to do a lot of walking!,0
"This is a mall, and they have stuff you can buy. Usually crowded on the weekends by people that don't know how to get the hell out of your way.",0
Great sushi bar. The staff and owner are extremely attentive. Great presentation. Decent price too. And I got to sit next to Mario Lemeuix at lunch a couple weeks ago!,0
"Passing by we stopped in for a quick slice of pie to fortify us for our continuing journey. Not disappointed, the pie was delicious! Seriously good Jam and a very keen and friendly owner.",0
get the spinach florentine bagel with jalopeno cream cheese! very yummy!,0
"Why does yelp force us to at least give one star? Yelp should realize some places deserve a negative rating. This place is one of them. Overpriced, badly cooked.",0
Good Pizza nice menu. Tried this place after seeing a yelp deal. Had a free slice waiting for my pie.,0
"I have been here about 5 times. Every time I go, they do a great service. The staff is always helpful and create a great atmosphere. Defiantly worth the $$$$.",0
The best Mexican food!  The chicken and cheese burrito is the best on the menu!  But I would suggest to do take-out because the place is not that nice to stay at.,0
I ordered a Chicken Gyro. The chicken was flavorless and extremely dry. The bread was a dry tortilla and not a fresh pita. Won't be back at all. I don't know how they stay opened.,0
"After dealing with a disaster from a 1-800 Flowers store, I went to The Blossom Shop and they were great! The flowers were top quality, and the service was what you should expect. I will definitely use them every time now!",0
"Amazing food, crappy service. slow, unattentive and almost rude.  Go for the food.",0
Pretty cool little biker bar.  Food was good typical bar portions with pretty standard bar.  It has a very large outside patio which I am sure make it the go to spot in the Arizona summer heat.,0
Average place.  Average food.  Fried stuff and fried burgers.  Loud.  Rowdy crowd for fish fry.  Much better places around... Unless you like average.,0
Charbroiled burger is fantastic. Delicious shakes. Friendly owner. Horrendous parking.,0
Rude staff. Always screw up online orders. Never ready on time.,0
"I place an order and I was put on hold for 25 minutes, crazy, I don't think I will order ever again.",0
OMG this is the slowest AIRPORT i have been to in the last 12 months.\n\nI have been in to 15 different Airports in the US in the last 12 months.,0
"I've been to this restaurant numerous times and I strongly recommend it! I love the ceviche and shrimp cocktails, both are absolutely EXCELLENT! If you are looking for a great lunch spot, it's a must!",0
"This place is more wonderful than expected.\n\nDinosaur bones, minerals, space science, Arizona history and science.\n\nIt is definitely worth the drive to Mesa :)",0
The food was good and our waitress was amazing. The menus were dirty and other customers were very loud. The wait on our food was a little longer then usual but it was worth the wait.,0
"Seem to have gone out of business. Nobody answers the phone, mailbox is full. Oh Well.",0
Not such a bad place. It has a reputation in some quarters as a sort of Mecca. You'll get good prices on decent Mexican in totally unpretentious surroundings. Not really Mecca,0
The Brioche french toast they're advertising now is amazing!\n\nService was quite good; I've been here before and it isn't always good.\n\nClean enough.  Decent prices.,0
"Below average Mexican food at best. And $6 for chips and guacamole? Unless you go to Chandler High, skip this place.",0
"I love coming to Coffee Rush. The employees are friendly, but more importantly, they are experts when it comes to crafting amazing espresso drinks.",0
Atmosphere needs a little upgrade in order to attract a bit of a younger crowd but I really like the menu and patio seating.  Happy Hour is decent too.,0
Was looking for a noodle place in phoenix and found Cherryblossom. It was fantastic! Definitely the place to go for ramen and udon. Hidden gem.,0
"Excellent, really great place. Really awesome vermicelli bowls. Ignore any reviews that are under five stars.",0
At least when you go to the shark reef at the mandalay bay... the sharks can't get you.\n\nThis place is like the used car dealership of furniture stores.,0
"I like their coffee much better than some of the other big names and the jelly donuts are \""to die for\"".",0
"I've never seen anything more ghetto in my life. Walmart is already disgusting, well times that by 3.6 million and you have the Nellis location. iky",0
"This Albertsons is pretty average, but one of the better options in the area.  Reasonable service in general, but the checker was nice.  For everyday groceries, the prices are good.",0
I'll have to find another option. The quality of my pedicure was great and the nail technicians were like robots; there's no enjoyment there at all.,0
"I was absolutely not impressed with this place.  However, I did try the chile and cheese tamales and they were pretty damn good.",0
"Review for mandarin pork chop, lunch menu and service. Mandarin pork chop is ok but not anything special. Got there 10 minutes before lunch special ends and was told its closed. Service was poor.",0
"Awful chinese food.  There are so many better places around south Charlotte than this sad excuse of a restaurant.  The food is tasteless, service is crappy, restaurant is dirty.  Please do yourself a favor and skip.",0
Customer service is terrible  doubt I will ever go back,0
"We dedicated 3 hours to Desert Botanical Garden - it's that good.\n\nI've seen immense variations of cacti here, probably more than I needed to learn - but it was a fun educational opportunity for sure.",0
Not a kid friendly hotel at all!!! Pool the size of a tub heater broken no jacuzzi!!!,0
The BEST sushi in the state. Try the Lobster Roll.,0
Actually one of the best airports I've been too. \nWould I go back? Hell yeah? \nAnytime soon? Hell no.,0
"Awesome. Outstanding staff, amazing climbing walls and cheap price.  If you like to climb, this is the place. Great workout or a place to take the kids to burn off energy. I'm coming back for sure!",0
I had the raspberry cheesecake for dessert yesterday.  Wow!!!  Good stuff.  My mom had the baklava-very nutty if you like baklava. It was like eating desserts on steroids!,0
"The only thing ive ordered here is a ruben sandwich and it was okay, I guess they have better things than this so I will try something else next time.",0
If you want good Mexican food do not go here. It's the Mexican version of mcdonalds and I will never have it again.,0
Worst sushi ever. I hate when sushi looks dried out right when you get it. I wouldn't eat here if you paid me and you would have to because it costs so much.,0
"Nuthin better after a few fun games of bowling down the street than a good Chinese meal at my favorite Chinese restaurant!   LOL  By the way, make sure to try their Chinese vegetables--they're authentic and delicious!",0
no matter what time you go to a trader joes there is always a pretty decent line to check out.  Just wish that the store had 2 more check out stands.,0
Worst strip club I've ever been to. Do NOT even think you could use coupons or think the manager will honor anything. Received a complementary free pass and was denied by the manager even though there was no restrictions. Worst service ever,0
Extensive menu.  Food ok but a little greasy but otherwise not bad.  Typical service at a Vietnamese restaurant.,0
"Horrible customer service, I do not recommend:-(",0
We are definitely fans of this place!  The veggie burger and wine burger are excellent. Loved the atmosphere. Very unpretentious as another reviewer posted.,0
"The food here is decent, and they offer a good value. They have been in that location for more than 25 years, so they must be doing something right.",0
"I love the baked ziti. The breadsticks cannot be beat. When I get my craving for simple pasta, this is my go to place. However, I have ordered meatballs to go as a side...And have never received them.",0
"I love Caffe Boa! Great drinks and delicious food, just one thing: what is UP with the size of the beet salad? A little skimpy, don't ya think? :)",0
We saw the original owner was back so we figured we would try out the pizza.  We were very disappointed in the food. We will not be going back.,0
I wasn't sure what to expect but nicely surprised!!! Awesome margaritas and the three enchilada dinner was amazing!   And so reasonably priced!  New favorite Mexican!!!,0
"It's the second Zipps that I've been to and it's pretty comparable to the other one. This one was a little smaller, but the beer selection was decent and the burgers were still okay (nothing to rave about).",0
"Very slow service, had to get our own drink refills. Bathrooms were in need if cleaning. \nBut the food was great.",0
A delicious Carne Asada burrito. I can't wait to go back and trust me it will be soon.,0
Please don't go by my rating as I have not ben there. I was looking for reviews on eyelash extensions and did not find any. Scary there are a lot of bad reviews and my eyes are pretty important. No room for error,0
"Very disappointed! Ordered delivery, food was cold and bland.  Worst general TSO chicken ever tasted.",0
"In a word: decent. This is the salty variety of Asian food with canned-tasting sauces and meat. It's about as good as the frozen dinners you can get at the grocery store, but it costs more.",0
"Whenever I am there, I always feel welcomed by the staff and I have never had a problem with service.  The food good and the atmosphere is fun.",0
"Horrible service, greasy food, orders always incorrect.   Go elsewhere!!",0
Wow. Great food. The chicken tikka masala is the best and the saag paneer is awesome too. Best Indo-Pak restaurant in the Phoenix area and Arizona hands down. They also have a location in Tempe.,0
It's good and cheap(in that area).,0
I've been sitting here for lunch for just about an hour. Took 45 minutes to get our appetizer and then 15 minutes more for salad and soup. There are 5-6 tables where I am sitting. This is unacceptable.,0
Delicious.  Loved the salsas as they were super fresh and you can request a spicier version.  Our dinners were just as delicious.,0
"The food at Pita Jungle is really good.  I love everything I have had there.  If you are there in the fall or spring, sitting on the patio overlooking the lake is really nice.",0
Best local donuts in Chandler.  Wide variety and quick service.  Must try local place.,0
"Super friendly staff, good prices, and I've heard rave reviews of the live entertainment they get.  Wish they had a menu, but it's just a little place.",0
"steven gave me a new set the other day, they came out great :) I will return.",0
we went there for lunch and they have a pretty nice lunch menu. i had their steakhouse burger and it was pretty tasty! would definitely go again because the price was definitely right.,0
"Very awesome place for bread. Very good. Go in early though because it will sell out :,(",0
"I've been to Hawaii a couple of times to visit an old friend who moved there. Whenever I crave a plate lunch here on the mainland like they do on the island, I usually hit up Aloha Kitchen.",0
The Baby Lobster and Las Vegas rolls are absolutely amazing! Great service and staff is always friendly. I have never had a bad experience here.,0
This was a cool dive bar.. too bad we got there in time for only round before they closed.. fun crowd!,0
Great park for family fun. They even host music festivals there which is fantastic. Something for everyone for sure!,0
Can get really busy then the service goes to hell! On the plus side the security guard will help you try on wigs.. he's quite adorable.,0
"Very overrated.  If you are expecting good Vietnamese good, you'll need to downgrade your expectation.",0
"Love the small town and family owned feel of this place! The staff was sweet, attentive and prompt...even on Mother' day!",0
"Fairly terrible experience.  We are avid Mexican food fans but this place is horribly overpriced, mediocre food.  On the bright side, the chips and salsa were pretty good.  The service was also fairly good.",0
Fun atmosphere and tasty steak. A place to take extended family when they come visit so they can see some of the area's history and leave with a full stomach.,0
Food was ok. Fries seemed like they were done already when we got them. Ostrich burgers were excellent though. Bar Tender at the time was somewhat condescending. Draft Beer was kinda warm. Sam the waitress was nice.,0
they have a great seafood section.. I/E swordfish steaks!! yummm.... they will also order you shark steaks!! mmmm yummm. they also carry socialist pork! lol.,0
"the deli is ok for lunch or if you want to pick up a quick dinner to go.  but everytime i'm here for groceries, i just wish for one thing: A Whole Foods in Champaign.",0
"Non attentive staff, VERY rude bartender. Left before getting waited on!",0
This buffet has gone up in price and down in quality. The food was horrible and there was barely anything to choose from. The place is dirty and we even found a hair in the food.,0
"Delicious food, wonderful lunch menu.  Super cute patio.",0
"Chips and salsa are always great, staff is friendly, coupons are always coming through my email, margaritas are delicious.",0
Target corp needs to take a look at this location. It's way past its prime. Feels more like a Walmart. I suggest you Yelp for another Target in your area and stay away from this one.,0
"Save your money!!!  You get quoted one price and get charged way more, happened not just once but twice!!!  Not worth it...",0
This was a great local hangout. Delicious thin crust pizza (we had the Big Johnson) and inexpensive beer. Tonight they had a fantastic guitar duo. Really fun to hang out and see the locals and watch a game or two.,0
"Not the best pizza in the world (it's also not the worst but at $5,  why complain.",0
I love the Goat Yogurt.. oh and their goats milk is the cheapest. The brown eggs are like farm eggs from home. Thank you Trader Joe's,0
The worst experience in my life. The menu is not clear and the waitress did a horrible job describing the ingredients.,0
"BEST Chinese food ever!  Love the people, the homemade food, the qwik special lo mein especially -this place has been in business for many years and is so amazing!",0
This place is really awesome! The food is very fresh and the prices are totally reasonable. The people are really friendly and I will definitely be back :),0
"Had to wait 15-20 minutes for the shuttle to fill, but simply paying the $12 (round trip) fee is so much easier than haggling with some of the limo drivers upon exiting the airport.",0
Giddy up. Food was actually ok. Service not so much.,0
"Great atmosphere on the patio. Servers were friendly and attentive. Food was good! I got the carne adobada plate. It was a  huge portion, plenty of left overs. Would definitely go back!!",0
"I'm surprised by some of the positive reviews this place has received. The food is horrible, and having lived near Jerusalem, let me tell you - the food here has nothing to do with Jerusalem. Just not worth going!",0
I like the rocking chairs and the view at sunrise at the end of terminal D.,0
Not very good Chinese food here. It reminded me of a cheap college place. They give you plenty of food but it is low quality. Could have probably went to another place and paid half the price for the same meal.,0
Pretty good sandwiches. Large sandwiches. \nWould say earl of sandwiches is better. \nCheese steak tastes similar to philly. Capastrami is good,0
"I really enjoy Chase's for breakfast. The omelets are really tasty, the service is always great, and the vibe is casual and laid back. A favorite.",0
Good assortment of riding gear for both off-road and street riding. Mediocre customer service. Average prices.,0

Two out of the three times that I have been here I have had a bad experience. My pedicure came out looking textured. It was a complete waste of money. I will not be going back.,0
"excellent food, and great service and even better prices. I will definitely be coming back.",0
Best Kung Pau Tofu ever!  Delivered right to my hotel room.  Really appreciate their can-do attitude toward a vegetarian.  Quite a contrast with Panda Express who said they don't do vegetarian.,0
"This place is awful, I had a 3:30 appointment, it is 4:40 and I still haven't been seen. Stay away from this place!",0
"The pollo especial may be the absolute worst Mexican dish that I have tasted, ever.  The fajitas are the only thing worth eating at this place, everything else I have tried has been extra salty and bland.",0

"Good service, food, and atmosphere. Am a repeat customer to this location. Very pleased.",0
Worst bacon egg and cheese bagel i ever had,0
"We ordered Hot and Sour Soup, Salt and Pepper Prawns and Honey Walnut Shrimp.  It was very good and quite inexpensive. Their dinner selection is more extensive and more authentic than their lunch choices.",0
"It's an institution, and if you live in AZ you need to eat here.  The food is off the charts and you'll leave very full with lots of money left over.  It doesn't get better...",0
"I'm pretty sure I will never come here again... It seemed really barren, floors were dirty, and it was extremely dusty in here! I did one lap around the store and left to get what I need elsewhere.",0
Fantastic chopped salad.  I had the pork shank; very good.  We went to dinner with another couple and really enjoyed the whole experience.,0
"The food is just ok... A little over priced compared to what you get. WIll choose a better steakhouse, at the same price point, before coming here again... very disappointed in quality, portion size, and price point.",0
"Not the best burger by any means, but passale   Horrendous setup by the drink machine almost impossible to get by because it is so crowded and tiny aisle to go past",0
"Front desk lady is nice nasty. Instructors are average at best. My daughter, who is a great dancer, was bored and unchallenged.",0
"I was in town for my daughters graduation and stayed here. The place is newly renovated, very clean and the staff was very nice. The breakfast was okay. The price was fair. I would defiantly stay here again",0
Had a fun time at the Phoenix Zoo with the kids yesterday.,0
Great shop. Very open layout and friendly staff. Sometimes parking can be difficult though as it is a small shared lot.,0

The food was great and the staff was super nice! They have really great coffee options and omelets with everything you can think of in them.,0
Didn't like the food at all. The chicken does not look like real chicken. Not sure what I was eating. Will not go back to eat here again.,0
They have great deals on Shampoos & Conditioners. I use Redken which is usually on sale either buy 1 get 1 free or buy 2 get 1 free I only wish they had good customer service.,0
"Good bartenders, biker friendly, food specials and kareoke thurs - sun. This is an awesome neighborhood bar!",0
Excellent independent coffee shop.  Hometown feel with NoDa culture.  Staff is friendly and the locals are interesting.  Good place to relax or have laid back business meeting.  Free Wifi and rocking chairs don't hurt either.,0
Yes I agree it is a easy airport to get in and out.  They have friendly screening people. Slot machines galore,0
Great location! It's the perfect walk from our place to grab some lunch. Everyone is always so nice and the food is always great!,0

The nurses are really superb with their beside manner. Very caring and attentive.,0
Great burger for the price. Always friendly service. One of the oldest burger spots in town!,0
"Good view good margaritas and bloody Marys. Went downhill fast, service and food below average.  Unfortunately I can't recommend.",0
"I've been going there for years and am always satisfied.  There have been plenty of opportunities to sell me something I didn't need., but Adam and Ron are straight-arrow all the way.",0
"Slow service and occasionally rude people working. I know it's only McDonalds but what happened to pride in work, whatever that work may be.",0
"Very nice facility, very nice staff and great coffee!! I can not complain.",0
Great menu selections and nice setting.  Waiters were very attentative and friendly.  However the food was too salty to our taste.  The only thing we liked is the vegetarian spring rolls.,0
This is a great pizza place!! The pizza is really fresh and tastes amazing! The price is really reasonable too!,0
I really enjoyed my meal! The strawberry lemonade and creamy cauliflower soup were great. Its exactly like a Fresh Choice for anyone from Northern CA.,0
"My wife and I go here pretty regularly. Sure its a large chain restaurant, but their Steak Fajitas and Queso are always great and the quality is pretty reliable. I've always had good luck with the service as well.",0
Need help right now with an ear ache?  Forget it.  First available appointment is two\nweeks.  By then I will have found a cure myself.  thanks,0
"Love the service and playground! Our family's top pick for \""family date night\""\nHave to try the cheesy chicken- crunchy and oh so flavorful!!",0
The food is good and fast.  This is a very busy lunch spot downtown.  However they always run out of salsa and that should never happen at a place like this.,0
"I like getting the Nacho Burrito, Steak Quesidillas, and the Chicken Burrito from here with fire sauce, even though it's still not that hot.",0
"I ate and drank at the lounge here during a recent summer stay at the Buttes.   I My favorite is the chips - the ones with bacon, blue cheese, and chipotle sauce...YUMM!",0

Food was pretty good... you pay for the view though.  BBQ nachos were superb.,0
"We visited due to its proximity. Wow! Great, convenient, local Mexican food. You know it's good if the local fire station is at the table next to you enjoying their food.",0
"The food was really good, the service was really bad.... Lindsey the FOH Manager took great care us and it wasen't neccessary. Thank You.....",0
"Place was quiet, room was clean, beds were comfortable, water was hot, less than $80. Happy Happy!",0
Everything on the menu has been a must eat so far! Love their curry chicken and fish with Saigon special sauce. Spicy basil chicken and teriyaki chicken is good too. A must go place if you are in Chandler.,0
"This is our go-to Chinese restaurant. They are always quick to get our tasty order ready. My husband doesn't come in that often, but the owner somehow always remembers his order. Good service and a pleasant experience.",0

"Had their machaca con huevos... It wasn't very good. There sopes and tacos are really good... 3 stars cuz the machaca was really disappointing. Usually I would give em 4,",0
Great little cafe in central Phoenix. Great food and adorable location! Better for lunch than dinner I think.,0
Airport is pretty big.  It's really spread out. I was surprised by the lack of food choices here. Seemed like it's kinda trashy as well but they could be remodeling. Really average airport.,0
Solid stadium and the higher seats have a surprisingly good view. The video is great and the sound is decent and a Panthers win always makes the experience much more memorable.,0
"Nasty food, the meat was old and cold and the veggies were even colder the employee was lazy and instead of making it fresh he decided to serve food that was sitting there for a while",0
"My eye examiner was Dr. Efrem Prado and he was very thorough, pleasant, and just plain nice! He was a delightful experience!",0
The architecture was gorgeous. Building is quite pretty and modern. I can't help but feel that there isn't much to see inside though. There were nice exhibits but it could have been a lot better if they added more substance.,0
"Fantastic dentist and staff. Professional, skilled, friendly and efficient, I highly recommend this dental practice.",0
"Worst customer service I've ever had. I would never go here again,  they are rude and treated me terribly.",0
Wow the Gulab  Jamun from here is AMAZING!!,0
Disappointing. Burger was cooked properly but lean and dry. Co\nle slaw was bland and Chili was essentially pork and beans without the pork. Good bar with great selection of tap beers. Sorry. Just not great food.,0
Great guacamole and salsa. The tacos were great. So much better than La fiesta. Fast and Friendly service. They also have a tortilla maker as well. Pretty neat.,0
"Nice, mellow atmosphere. We had the pear and Pecan salad which was fresh and delicious. The pizza was great--fresh ingredients and arrived hot. Friendly staff.",0
"The margaritas are wonderful as are the chips and salsa.  The rest of the food was okay, not great.  The service was wonderful.",0
The restaurant was ok for teh price.  The food was so so. The cat fish was too spicy. The salad was too small for $10.,0

Food was good! Lemonade was excellent! And the owner is spunky and interactive! Can't go wrong with whatever you order!,0
"I order for Papa Johns all too frequently, and am almost always greeted by friendly delivery staff in less than my quoted time. If you use the PJ app or order online you can earn points towards free pizza. Got to love that!",0
Ask for spicy level. Tom Yang Gong is spicy but very light sour.  Musamman curry is very tasty!,0
One of my favorite places to eat. They have so many great options and I am never disappointed. This place is a must try!,0
"Used to like this theater but recently I've found the excessive talking, cell phone answering and other shenanigans that are allowed to go on during movies to be unbearable.  Go to the mills or waterfront instead.",0
"Greeted by Marty, service was fast and efficient, food was hot and exactly what I ordered. There was plenty on the plate to share with my son and left overs! Great joyous conversations taking place around us. Good family environment.",0
this place is awesome. they have excellent combo meals esp for lunch the prices are ridiculously low! great value. the food is very yummy and they give generous portions for great prices. love this place.,0
This place has horrible service! That's straight to the point! Never coming here again!!!! Not worth the aggravation!!,0
At AJ's you can buy fresh baked pizza. Try it. It's honestly one of best pizza's you will ever have. \nStaff is very nice. Overall great experience.,0
"I usually love this place, but I just ordered 20 wings and not only did it take way longer than I was told, but there are 20 drumsticks and that's it. All drumsticks! Who does that!?",0
I visit this Subway several times a week. Staff are very friendly. Good customer service. Ingredients seem pretty consistently fresh. It's a standard Subway but differentiated by friendly staff and good service.,0
"A co-worker recommended the place. The food is inexpensive, bland and the restaurant has the decor of a double-wide. Never again, especially with all of the other great options on the area.",0
It's a pretty good breakfast place. Kind of like Denny's and their service there is alright. It's more of a good rest stop type of diner than a family friendly diner.,0
"The prices were what you might expect for this area, and the facility seemed clean, but this was the loudest movie theatre I've ever been to. Even with earplugs I could hear every line of the movie clearly.",0
Fast! Repaired three mangled pairs of glasses in under 10 minutes for under $20. Great service and super fast!,0
"Service department was more than helpful. I just bought my car from another dealership, but I would not rule out buying the next one here.",0
Nothing positive to say about this venue. I am always disappointed when a band I love plays here.,0
The food is really good and the price is pretty good for all you can eat! However its kinda dirty and small so you would have to wait in a long line if it gets busy.,0
Looooooove this place! Excellent place to find unique and fun gifts for the hard-to-buy-for people in your life. A must stop whenever I'm in Madison.,0
"Good chinese delivery. Quick, hot, lots of flavor. I'd recommend they use a bit less salt, as some of the dishes had a lot of it. Aside from that, good stuff.",0
After going to LuLu's tacos I feel I was premature with 5 stars here.,0
"I have been in search of good food for breakfast and kept getting this place as a recommendation. However, after visiting I thought the food was not as good as even a IHOP. I wouldnt go back or travel for this place",0
This place has the best salsa and great prices! it is made fresh every day and can't beat it!!,0
"Just hit the drive thru at this place. Ordered large Fries and a large coke. My fries were half full, my coke is all ice, and they didn't give me a straw or ketchup.",0
Good serviceable bar food.  A inexpensive meal and better than places like Showmars and about the same price.,0
Great diner food! I recommend the hanlons handful for breakfast! Great price and right amount of food.,0
"It is an ok indian restaurant, the quality is not vwry low but it is alao not high at all",0
"Have never eaten there, but went for cocktails after a show. The atmophere is very nice, slightly upscale, but not too upscale, and the drinks were reasonably priced. Would go again for sure!",0
Sushi selection limited...  Miso soup tasted a little fishy.,0
The dishware is dirty. I can see leftover soy sauce on my spoon. Cup are also leftover tea marks.,0
"Wow!  I have lived in the area for over 10 years and love Mexican food.  Unfortunately, this is the worst food I have had in many years.  Choose another place!",0
"Good hotel experience. Close to airport. Clean property with very friendly service. A bit sprawled out, but on site transportation is easily available. Good gym. Heavenly brunch. Try the huevos rancheros!",0
"This hospital is horrible. Don't go here. They did nothing for my daughter. I agree with the other bad reviews. It's old, smelly and dirty. The staff could care less about you. It's a revolving door.",0
"Sadly, this place is closed now. Owner moved back to Cali.",0
"Fresh coffee, quickly and excellently prepared pancakes, friendly service - everything that you can expect from a breakfast shop. Loved it.",0
Defiantly not the best Mexican food. Pollo Rico was dry. Chips and salsa tasted like pace.,0
"Yes I am still a fan.\nSitting in my room right now and learned that if you care to have quiet DO NOT LET THEM GIVE YOU A ROOM WITH A CONNECTING DOOR,,,, EEEE GADS.",0
Very nice range also got my CCW at this place great instructor. This place has everything from buying a new or used gun and all of the accessories from holsters to ammo.,0
Airport is not too bad. Lines can get long at times. The free wifi by the airport is awesome.,0
"In comparison to Chandler Gringos, I like this one much less. It was DEAD on a Friday night and nothing special going on with pricing. We got a drink and bounced out to the next place.",0
"Worst front desk staff ever. I books my room in July for a conference in Oct, and only upon arrival was I told that they moved me to Fairfield Inn. HORRIBLE",0
We have been coming here for years. The staff is great and they are good about making appointments to reserve a cage.,0
I will not recommend this restaurant. They used to be good two years ago. I dont know if they change their chef.,0
"I love this place! Lots of selections, but one of my favorites is the California burrito with no rice.",0

"pretty good, the eggtarts are bomb, service was good. typical dim sum place, gets the job done",0
"Service at the bar was good, food not so good.  My fault for ordering mashed potatoes at a Mexican restaurant.  Entree size very small for the price.",0
It's pretty average Chinese food. Their egg rolls and dumplings were decent enough as was the Hawaii Five O dish I had was ok too. The service is a little slow as well.,0
I called to ask if they buy swords.. And the guy hung up on me. How rude.,0
The manager is useless. Machines are broken and never repaired for long periods of time. The only advantage to joining this club is for the hours!!,0
"This place was OK, a litle dirty like their AC vents above where the food is being prepped and made. Which to me is a no no. The food was ok, a little pricey I think. Staff friendly though.",0
"The burgers are fresh and hearty, but the lettuce provided kept falling out of my burger. But overall the guacamole bacon cheeseburger was fantastic! The fries could've used a little less salt.",0
"Excellent food and large family style portions, my favorite is the veal parmesan. Been here numerous times and they get really busy, not always the best service and is pretty pricey.",0
Had the stupid fries and they were stupid good. Lemonade was also on point.,0
I read some positive reviews so I thought if try this place. Arrived at 4:30 to find them closed. Although posted hours are 9-5. Less than stellar first impression.,0
"1st trip to the gold spike, they fixed it up nicely, from what I hear it was. Love that The same person that works the players club booth  had to hand pay all machines. Very old school",0
"Terrible food, terrible prices, terrible service. I'll never eat here again or order room service from the stratosphere hotel since this is the kitchen that supplies it.",0
Jessica did an amazing job on my hair! I will send all of my friends and family over there! I will send everyone there!,0
Have been going there for about 3 years. I usually go there to get some cold beers. I lalways get draft Kirin Ichiban. They offer great variety of foods and desserts. Employees are very attentive and kind.,0
"A fabulous airport. Eat at Chelsea's kitchen if you have a minute or get take out if you don't. TSA was pleasant, jovial and quick - how often can you say that?",0
"Food has good flavor, but I would have preferred a bigger portion of meat and hotter food. They really aren't out to impress, only to fill your belly.",0
Outstanding donuts.  The regular donuts are much better than Dunkin or Krispy Kreme.  The cake donuts are about the same.  Definitely our new go-to donut place!,0
Simple sweet little course. Expansive views of the LV Strip.,0
I love Michael V! So happy to have this talented in charge of my hair!,0
"Our go-to restaurant, where the food and service are always excellent.",0
"The food is amazing, but you might want to consider carrying a weapon when you come. You might end up getting shanked.",0
Great service the staff all have great smiles.  Oatmeal and turkey sausage links with black coffee.  The pecans and cranberries make the oatmeal tasty,0
I was taken away with how cute and comfortable the restaurant was. The atmosphere was outstanding! Our server didn't have the best knowledge but was super nice and attentive.,0
Had been going to this place since Tea Planet days but as of late the quality of food and the service has gone from fair to poor. Gone are the days of prompt service and generous servings of food and sides.,0

"Bad place to eat, tastes like dog food, bland and no taste, I swear they use canned dog food or some garbage, this place I will never go to again!",0
First all kind and fast service. Good atmosphere the food was great. They have a bunch of options to choose from.,0
food isn't cheap. but they have great coupons! Good food!  Killer salads!,0
"It is a pretty pricy Thai restaurant. But there is not too much competition for them in Charlotte, so you got to go with it. I just like their mee krob.",0
This dentist is by far the worst I have ever been to. His manner is rude and if you won't get everything he recommends he does not seem to care. Just a mean man.,0
"Fast service, but wasn't impressed by pork broth pho.  Ended up just eating rice noodles & veggies only to avoid broth, had a funny aftertaste. Some of their other food looked very tasty though...",0
The staff here is SUPER friendly and very helpful. I couldn't ask for a better experience in a situation I didn't really want to be in (spending money on tires).,0
The workers were extremely friendly and the bagels were amazing. All you can drink coffee?YES! I wish we had one of these in California and next time I go to Arizona I will make it a top priority to come back.,0
"Wow. What a disappointment. Dirty plates, coffee was horrible and the water tasted like linen. Never come here.",0
This place is gross. The food is not good at all.\n\nMy husband and I were in search for good Mexican food (and still are) good thing we only ordered one burrito I couldn't even choke it down,0
"Very pushy! I went with my mother who is fighting cancer, I was shocked at how pushy they were with her. They are taking advantage of cancer patients.",0
It's like Mexican food without being super greasy. Else everything is good here. Service is good as well.  Wish this place was bigger that's all.,0
"Will never go here again. Carne Asada had no flavor, and the torta left a horrible taste in our mouth.",0
Italian Beef was good as were the fries. The highlight was the homemade Italian Ices. Good place for lunch and prices were not bad. Will be back for sure.,0
I like going to this place because it is close to work and rarely busy.  The people are nice and they do a decent job!,0
Not bad for a beer and burger at the bar if you're on a business trip. I'm sure there's better choices in the area though.,0
"Houston's, you're a national chain.  Please tell your staff at this location that you are not a three star Michelin restaurant.",0
Service an atmosphere was great. I had the shrimp boil and it was very under-seasoned. Much closer to bland than anything.,0
Every time we go thru the drive thru. The guy that works the window always have a bad attitude like he doesn't want to be there. When we ask for green hot sauce he always seems irritated due to our request.,0
"Clean, quick to get through security.  Be warned - depending on when you arrive, the taxi lines could be massively long and take about 45 minutes to one hour wait to get a taxi...",0
Meh.  They don't deliver to Swissvale.,0
Thas was absolutely horrible.  The table cloth was dirty.  The buffet was small and not very appetizing looking.  The bathroom was moldy.  Stay away!,0
"I love this place.  The food is fresh and high quality.  For as good as the food is, the prices are great!  Highly reccommend if you have never been!",0
Tasty sandwich. I gave 3 stars only because I drove 45 minutes to try their sandwich. The sandwich while tasty did not impress me to worth the long drive.,0
Not much in the way of culinary excellence in Sun City West. This particular Applebee's not only had microwaved crappy food but made me sick. Stay away.,0
"Order accuracy!!! Hot fudge Sundaes are not made with mint chocolate chip ice cream, idiots. Third time that the drive through window has completely screwed up our order. Never again",0
"Gorgeous. Definitely worth a visit, especially with the Chihuly exhibit installations. I love this place & go at least twice a year!",0
These folks were okay.  They took care of our problem from another Camping World without a hitch.,0
"Awesome place to go. Their motto says it all, \""little place, big flavors\"" or something like that. It's just really really good.",0
Good prices but not cutting edge as far as fashion or quality of merchandise.  Lines to check out can be a little long at times.,0
"Nice atmosphere and good service but the food is not so great.  Had wings, fries and ribs, all not good.",0
Not a bad dive bar. Nothing to write home about. Been there a few times good prices and friendly staff!,0
I tried their chocolate cupcake with buttercream frosting and loved the cake but not the topping. I will certainly return though to try their other goodies!,0
Great food!  Loved their Irish stew. The staff is friendly and the decor is cute but not hokey.,0

This is very near to my place. Not crowded and good place to do your quick shopping.,0
"La Tolteca is dead, long live La Tolteca! :-(",0
Three weeks later and my machine has tension problems like never before. Guess where I won't be going to get it fixed?,0
I love this Sephora. The employees are always very helpful and nice. The customer service is amazing. I love that you can enter the store from outside so that you do not have to go through the entire mall.,0
"This is a chain and should be thought of as such! Not the best I have every had but, the service was excellent. You have to get there at about 5:00 or wait for okay food, in a store-front location.",0
Amazing bagels but average service. They are under staffed and also the manager isn't the nicest. She has a bit of an attitude.,0
I found decent prices here and I did feel a little out of my element I couldn't understand the names on their packaging. I bought some bamboo spoons for 35 cents each. I love wooden spoons for my tea.,0
"High quality ice cream, great flavors, and a Pittsburgh original. What more could you want? :)",0
"If you Love Butter this is the place for you, it is yummy & delicious quick friendly service & the potatoes are tasty!\nNo credit cards this place is cash only",0
Prarie Cafe & Bakery exists in one of those cafe/restaurant purgatories in which nothing is offensive and nothing is remarkable.,0
I try to never eat here.  The food is bland and overpriced.,0
LOVE veggie tofu soup. I always order the spicy ones. The price is reasonable.,0
It's great because it was a weekday and no one else was there. :),0
"The food is just as great as the Penn Avenue location, but it gets an extra star for being CLEAN.  This time I tried a sausage sandwich.  Not as good as the Rothlesburger.  The fries are awesome.",0
"I like the food and donuts, but and more importantly, I really like the people who run this place and the people who hang out there.",0
Clean store. Staff was nice. They had lots of christmas clerance toys yay!,0
The lovely ladies that work here obviously know what they're doing. Great service and quality even during the lunch hour. Prices are great. Can't wait to go back and try more items.,0
We always enjoy the service and good food. Also can't beat the ice cold beer with dinner.,0
Good Pizza. The service wasn't so great. The decor...not so great. The brick oven is visual when you first enter which is cool. I would go back.,0
"I went to this diner with some friends. I had never been here before but passed it many times never noticing it. By far the best diner in pittsburgh. If ur hungry and this is an option, I definitely recommend this place.",0
Love this place they always get remember me and my order :),0
Went here for lunch while visiting Pioneer Village. We all ordered cheeseburgers and thought they were really good. There is a really neat old bar in there worth checking out.,0
Great place to eat! Make a reservation on the weekend or you will have to wait!,0
"Good stuff but only worth it with coupons for free entree when you buy one and it is still pricey, they really get you on the price of the coffee.",0

New Mexico style food.  Tasty and big portions.  A beautiful patio area out back.,0
Dirtiest  jack in the box ever!!  I grew eating jack in the box an this is a Peru excuse for one.,0
Genuine italian old-style restaurant where the food as well the service lived up to my high expectations. Well worth the relatively high prices. I'll be back!,0
Nice clean place;  can get busy at lunch; today I noticed some serious attitudes amounst the crew here.  They seem very apathetic;  this may point to a management issue with this location.,0
"I have been going to this place for years. From 16th street to Tatum to 27th avenue. One thing that they all all do the same is the \""Parisian\"" omelette. Tasty and fast.",0
Absolutely love their brisket sandwich!\nNothing compares to this sandwich. But I wish they were open until later for those late night cravings!,0
Convenient and quick.  The prices are reasonable and the people who work here are friendly.  No real complaints.  Check for coupons!,0
First timers with a large party. Everybody liked food and service except the halibut was awful.,0
Good atmosphere but very bad quality of food.. price is ok but I guess you can't ask for more when it has a poor flavor. I would comeback for the atmosphere but not so much for the food,0
Food was average at best when you consider the price.  Our table had a broken leg being held up by a plate and portions of food were extremely small,0
I don't know why I always shop around bc I know Pruitts will have the best price. I wish they had a better website.,0
"one of the best chinese food here in phoenix. you have to tell them to use less salt. because often times, the food just a bit too salty. other than that. it has great selection for Szechwan style food.",0
Took in two laptops to be unlocked and reset.  They got the job done but the quality of service was horrible!  The assistant manager gave me sarcastic remarks and I was definitely not impressed!  Not going back,0
"The hotel is old, and even with the new remodel, its still old.  I dont think I'll be back here anytime soon",0
"Favorite dive bar. Get the dise burger - awesome! Cheap beer and drinks, very divy, so not for the faint of heart.",0
"You're right...small town, homey feeling...nice waitresses from the high school...poor food!  What else is there?",0
"The owner is an ignorant egotist. Talks down to customers and is amazingly rude. I wont be going back, even with really low prices, I don't like being treated rudely.",0
"As their company name says, they are very careful movers. They moved a heavy piano with no difficulty, and no damage to walls or piano. I would highly recommend them.",0
"Gross, plain and simple!  I'll crave some quick Chinese Food and then I'm always upset.  What a waste of money!",0
We had very attentive service and excellent meals. Our waiter did a great job explaining the specials.,0
Place was pretty nice with a lot of the upper scale stores.  See the other review for more details.,0

There is a Clover machine in this location!!! Good service and surprisingly accessible parking for a location inside a grocery store.,0
"I found this store's guns to be fairly pricey.  Good selection, but i ended up buying elsewhere.",0
Done here!  Stop the high-pressure sales tactics.  Telling me that using non- synthetic oil will void my manufacturer warranty is a complete lie!  Never again will I patronize this intentionally dishonest company!,0
Excellent food. Not pretty and I wish they would invest but it is clean and has a friendly staff. Food is fresh and excellent!,0
i went there once a while back and it was dirty and never went back... but if Stevey is right about the drink specials i might have to re-visit,0

"Pei Wei, you give Pad Thai a bad name.",0
Called and found out Rob's gone!  So gave them another whirl and service on my bike couldn't have been better.,0
A family tradition the past 6 years. My favorite is the Carlos Carnitas Dinner. My wife likes the Little Bit of everything Plate. They have Happy Hour as well and the prices are reasonable.,0
"Food was not fresh, bland, and overall unappetizing.  I love this Middle Eastern food, but this was a disappointing meal.",0
Fresh and tasty. No two dishes taste alike and they are always efficient getting orders together. I just wish they delivered!,0
Prices are great but received an article of clothing back with a hole in it. There are better dry cleaning options in the area.,0
Door clearly says drive-thru open 24 hours and lobby till midnight. Drove up at 10:30 and was told the lobby was closed...lame...,0
Pretty good park for the kids. Not the best kept but if you are in the area it is ok.,0
Great German atmosphere and real good food.  There was a good accordion player and the apple strudel was great.,0
"I love this place!\n\nIt's not fancy, it's a little corner diner but their coffee is very good.  Better than some of our local coffee shops even.  Their breakfast is much better t",0
Pretty damn good.  The veggie samosa was yums.,0
Not the same since it was sold years back. They changed the sauce and the gyros shrunk. Go to Mike & Tony's downtown for the best gyros.,0
Excellent food and a very good price. We go here at least twice a month. My kids also love the food!,0
"One of the few golf shops you can tape up a club you want to buy and go hit balls on their range. The pricing is and selection is good, and the staff are attentive and friendly.",0
"I've used plenty of car services all over the country and Ridesmart is the best.  Courteous, timely, nice vehicles, at a great price.  Won't use anyone else in the Phoenix area.",0
"I drove by this location earlier today and was a little sad that they were closed for good... then I realized, who needs Borders when you have a perfectly good Half Price Books across the street? And a B&N nearby?",0
"My wife and I went for our first visit and were thrilled by the knowledge, passion, and true healing that Dr. Nemanic provided. He instantly diagnosed solutions for problems that have long nagged at us. Wholeheartedly recommend him.",0
food is bad  don't go  save your money    you should just eat your 5 dollar bill it would tast better,0
I came in for a cleaning and was very impressed by Dr. O and staff!!! Will me returning for my next cleaning. Professional and clean.,0
One time I was there it took them about 15 minutes to just get someone to the cash register come on! I eventually just left.,0
Poor customer service walked in there has to get my daughters hair cut right away they said it be 45 minutes.  No one was in there. I understand appointments but learn customer service and try saying hello.,0
"This target took out a that photo Center now they just have the portraits studios  it was nice to make your own photos and copies but that service is long gone stores pretty big they, The produce always fresh along with the meet.",0
I go here because the prices are the best around and it's close to home. I've found that the later you go the stranger the crowd gets!,0
"It was fine until the girl stocking in the grocery section just stared at me, then gave me a dirty look and turned around.",0
Food was delicious and our waitress was really sweet and attentive.  It did have a dirty feel/vibe to it though which was hard to get past.,0
"Feels like a step back in Wisconsin time, the interior design and furniture is all cut, carved from local materials. Food is average, service is average.",0

"Wasn't that bad, definitely nothing to eat. All the workers are idiots but that's life.",0
The service was excellent. My salmon was cooked to perfection.This is a great place to get Northern Italian food.,0
"This is such a hidden Ahwatukee gem! We love this place. Good family friendly atmosphere, good pizza and the best spinach salad you will ever eat! Prices are good and ridiculously good for salads. This is a must try!",0
This is one of the worst McDonald's locations I have ever been to. It's always bad and doesn't matter what time or day they consistently disappoint.,0
No flavor. food tastes like the Chinese buffet places. Ordered a sesame chicken expecting a heavy dark sauce. In return I got a honey flavored chicken plate.,0
"the Bento boxes are awesome, as well as the cheap sushi.\nthe yakiniku is by far my fav, next to the Spam onigiri.\n\n: D",0
Favorite thai place! I'm obsessed with the crab rangoon and yellow curry!,0

Overpriced drinks served by lousy inept bartenders.,0
"Great neighborhood bar with decent wings. I don't come here for the social scene, but enjoy the food and big screen TVs.",0
Nothing special here just over priced Mexican food. Got two breakfast burritos and paid $15.00.,0
Had the oil changed in our VW at Kensington today. Friendly and fairly priced. Would definitely recommend them.,0

The food here is okay...\nbut the service here is horrible.\nI would not recommend this place at all!!,0
"This place was alright, my nephew wasn't too fond of of him barbecue chicken wings. I asked the owner for something different, he made a big deal about it. so we got stuck with unwanted bbq wings.",0
This is consistently one of the slowest Starbucks I go to. There seems to be constant turnover in staff. Quality of products are similar to all other Starbucks,0
You'll know when you've hit it.\n\n(Ba-dum crash!),0
Brought the entire family tonight to taste the goodness! Ordered multiple crazy roller coaster rolls. Love the tuna and salmon sashimi.,0
"Good food, very fair price, and a nice variety on the lunch menu. The service was pretty quick. I ordered the sweet basil with beef and was not disappointed. I would gladly go back.",0

Gilbert Yoga is one of the best yoga studios I have ever been to.  The staff is amazing and the atmosphere... well you have go to experience it.  Wonderful experience!!,0
"The Sunday brunch is good but not great, the place is a great steelers baron Sunday's",0
Under staffed terrible service. If you want a beer your forget it. The girls who man the counter can't serve. The ones who can are running the main counter cooking pizzas getting balls unstuck what ever.,0
"Smelled like pee, had tweekers standing outside looking like they couldn't wait to break into your car the minute you walked inside & no one noticed us or seated us so we left. Won't go back there ever again.",0
"Parking is always a jam, but the food and atmosphere rocks.",0
Most expensive Sam Woo that I've ever been to.  Easily 40% more them other places.  My noodle was extra salty too.  Cash only. Portions are way smaller than other Sam Woo.,0
The worst excuse for Chinese food! The only tying I ate were the fortune cookies.,0
The best steak I've had I a long time! Very tender steak and the best twice baked potato ever. Service was wonderful to match!!,0
I would suggest Az grand resort for your stay vacation. Awesome water park for the children and lots to do for adults as well plus its very close and you Dont have to drive for hours to get to your destination. Enjoy and stay cool,0
My first and last time.  Not much flavor in the food.  Fried rice was soggy and hot and sour soup was weak on all accounts,0
"Great italian food.  My favorite was the half cannelloni, half manicotti plate with red sauce and a splash of alfredo.  Not on the menu, yes I was that difficult.  Great rustic setting too.",0
"The Howie bread was excellent, the pizza was ok....  too much sauce, causing it to be soggy, but still pretty good",0
"This place is amazing! The food is delicious, the place is clean and the service is lightning fast! I have absolutely no complaints I'll definitely be back!",0
Be patient.  It's a nice airport but it does get chaotic.  Scheduling seems to be random and gates get really busy with flights leaving right next to or across from one another.,0
"We live right around the corner, and frequently come here. Their food is good, service is better. Any time of the day or day of the week, great service. Good menu choices for the kids, and fast service.",0
"First time eating here today, food was great, service was very quick. Lunch portions for price was great!",0
"You better ask for the things you would normally would expect from any other location,  napkins, fork,  straw, cocktail sauce.",0
"I wasn't very impressed with the food. Service was friendly.\n\nOther reviews have summed it up pretty well.  Decent, reasonable, nothing exceptional.\n\nStandard Mex, yo.",0
Stopped in here when we visited Phoenix.  Great food and lots of it.,0
Bad food. Bug problem. In a neighborhood full of homeless roaming the streets like zombies.,0
Purchased a groupon for this place.  The service was excellent and the deluxe prime rib sandwich and the chipolte burger were fantastic.  You can bet we will visit again wifalsethout,0
I love their teriyaki rice bowls. I don't eat Sushi so I have no opinion about that. Great place for a quick lunch or dinner.,0
"Not the greatest place ever. has a pretty massive indoor pool which is great. The beds aren't special, the TVs are old, and the breakfast is horrible. It's not expensive so whatever, that's what you get.",0
chicken buns werent good. egg custard tart not good. ham and cheese bun not good.,0
All the people here are super nice. I really enjoy to have meal here. The price is  also really reasonable. Every dollar you spent here worth more then it.\nI would like to go there with my friends next time.,0
Food is definitely authentic & very good. Salsa was too watery for my liking & not very zingy. Burritos were HUGE!!!,0
Good food but odd that they lost my lunch order. Thanks to those manning the counter who realized I was waiting and filled the order on the spot.,0
"Funny how everyone here on yelp is fascinated with the bread at Tutto. Don't get me wrong, it was good but the rest of the food was delicious too!",0
Staff sucks! Dislike this store alot. Long lines. Unhelpful staff! I prefer oreilys!,0
I like the fact the food came out so fast once ordered! & especially during the lunch hour! Staff was friendly & helpful. The & lunch specials were good portions & great price!,0
"A Madison institution. Beer list? Beer List! Great food, and part of the Essen Haus empire when it comes to beer.",0
"Good food, good service. More of a bar than restaurant.",0
"Great out of the way place, if you are looking for good Mexican food off the strip, friendly service, a great value.",0
"Pretty decent... At least for a McDonald's. Probably one of the faster/more efficient ones out there, even though it was really busy and crowded.",0
This airport is huge. So big that I would never want to transfer flights here with different airlines because I don't know if I would make it in time. Big plus that there is free wifi and decent food options,0
Did the easter brunch there.  Service was slow.  Food not good enough to visit again.,0
"The signage at the airport was poor if you do a cross terminal.  In addition, I met the rudest TSA agent I have ever dealt with when asking about which terminal American Airlines was in.  It was like I was bothering him.",0
"It was good,  your typical Greek-style restaurant offerings.  Nothing much more to write about.  if you've been to any decent Greek restaurant, you've \""been\"" here.",0
bedbugs!!!!\n\nI am covered in bites- the place seemed clean but the bugs were there. I went through this at home and an infestation is a horrible thing to live through,0
Great book selection.  Not a comfortable place to sit and skim your book before you purchase. Overall an okay experience.,0
"nothing special on the menu. ive had the Pizza, and their Chicken Breast Hero. and both were just average.",0
The food was A-Okay. The winner here are the pies! So many to choose from all of them homemade. I give an extra star for that and also the customer service is great too. Everyone is so helpful and friendly.,0
"If you are a pizza person. like me, this is okay chain pizza.",0
"This is the bar where you walk in with $25 bucks and walk out not remembering the night. A true classic dive bar! Good times, which is usually based on who you are with.",0
"Fabulous food, great service, enjoyable live entertainment on a Wednesday night!!!! Great place for Cajun fare!!!",0

"The food was good, service was good, homemade tea tasted good. Honestly, we had no complaints about this restaurant. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area.",0
"Nice, relaxing atmosphere. Food was well presented and good.",0
This is the slowest Starbucks drivethru ever. I don't know what they are doing differently than every other sbux but it's killing me. The coffee and food are always good but it takes forever.,0
"Sat at the bar and had a very good experience. The lettuce wedge salad is excellent and the burger was done to perfection. The service was very attentive at the bar. A good place to watch a game, have a drink, and eats.",0
"Poor poor service, then they finally show up and then away they go to have long conversation with some friend. Door is just OK",0
Have only been here for lunch as I work around the corner and don't live too close. The pizza has been excellent every time as well as the service. If you like think crust not greasy pizza - give them a try.,0
"I have nothing against dives, as long as they're clean and the food is good. This place was not. The chips were greasy and stale. The food had no seasonings. Won't be going back.",0
"Great coffee, nice ambiance, ecclectic crowd, I went in planning to people watch state street while enjoying a caffeine boost and spent most of my time eavesdropping on the bizarre conversations going on around me...very entertaining.",0
Horrible it's smell horrible it was super dirty worse food experience ever,0
Best karate center ever.Highly recommend attending. Teachers are firm but fair. Facility is good and students are friendly.,0

"Hands down, my favorite Pho spot in Vegas. I always get the Grilled Pork Vermacelli bowl. I take all my friends there. Quick service and delicious food!",0
UMMMMMMMM the worst group of food reps and company BS I have ever seen in 22 years in the restaurant business.,0
"Always clean and usually has anything I'm looking for in stock. Most of the product is way more expensive than Walmart, but it's good for the convenience. Some of the employees are grumpy, but I overlook it most of the time.",0
My favorite place for Mexican food. Relaxed by the lake\nI have never been dissatisfied,0
Just a little update I forgot to add that the building may be old and dated but the place is the incredibly clean you can eat off this floor anywhere in the people are so nice check it out.,0
"We had Matt and he was awesome. Very professional and nice, amazing service! highly highly recommend! Ask for Matt!!",0
The sushi specials at happy hour are worth giving this place a try.\n\nlocated on southest corner of tatum and thunderbird next to kinko's.,0
Mediocre food with mediocre service for a big price. Not worth it.,0
"Popular place with the locals.  My relatives and I go to Sam's town about once a month.  Mostly play keno.  Last time we were there, my sister in law won $60,000 at keno!",0
The service is horrible!!! They do not give any utensils for the dishes. The waiters attitude is bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
Both my wife and I got sick the next day after eating at Carrabba's.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive but the food was not prepared fresh or kept at safe temperatures. We will not be eating here again.,0
"Menu looked good but the breakfast burritos were horrible.  Destroyed my day, should have went to Fausto's!  Never again and my boss agreed.",0
just try the pretzels!!!!!!! they are heaven.,0
Horrible food very salty and greasy. They forgot one of our orders but the food was so bad we canceled it and left you pay for what you get gross never again,0
"Horrible care. The staff knows the wire mesh crates hurt pet's paws on multiple occassions, and yet they do nothing about it. Shame on PetSmart, which should be renamed PetCruel.",0
The food is delicious enough to eat every last bite of the large portions. Can't get enough!,0
"A great place for teens to hangout after school in the open lab - they have a 3D printer, sticker cutters, recording equipment, art drawing tablets and games!",0
"Not much of a selection at any of the stores, it's all junky leftovers from 2 seasons ago.  I won't go back.",0
Great place to get an authentic meal. Great wine selection with generous portions. The house dressing is to die for.,0
Ordered but then she kept telling me all their different specials. Finally said ok to 3 roast beefs. Just got home. Order totally wrong. Not going back.,0
Very stylish restaurant with a great street view. Food can be on the spicier side here which is a plus. Worth checking out based on the price point.,0
I just don't get it.  The food is terrible and way overpriced.,0
This place is pretty good! they serve a selection of creatively topped dogs and some of the best greasy fries I have had in awhile. enough said!  Time to go drink some beer and devour this dog!,0
The food was just delicious!  We found this location based on Yelp and we were totally happy with our dinner here.  I highly recommend eating here when you get the chance.,0
every thing people say about the service is true. horrible...,0
This place has the best sushi hands down!!\nGet the hawain 5.0 and the primo!! They are life changing,0
Got their chicken and pesto pizza. Very good and filling. Not busy in there at all.,0
I remember Cracker Barrel for having great home cooked food. Maybe it's what we ordered but it seemed like standard restaurant food. Great service!,0
Pharmacy: They only have 1 person staffing this location. Takes more than 30 minutes to fill a Rx.,0
Nice find off the beaten path of Mill St. Food was really fresh. Pad thai yummy. Beef salad and spring rolls to start were fresh and hot. Each dish was really good. Would have loved a beer or wine ;-),0
"if it helps, this place really smells like a bookstore.\neven from the street as you are walking by and their door is open.",0
i have been going this place now almost 20 years plus.  great food good people what more can u ask for....,0
Excellent service and a cute little place in historic Glendale. Beautiful little tree-lined street and a lively patio. I had the tomato mozarella sandwich and tomato noodle soup. Both were very good. I'll be back for lunch.,0
"Great food, bad management and service. Get take out!",0
"Compared to some of the Japanese i have had around Charlotte, this place was the best so far,(from what Ive tried) the sushi came out looking beautiful and the service was up to par. I will be going back",0
Simple subs. I have always liked blimpe subs they taste great. Simple assembly line style sub making.,0
If it were possible I would give this place zero stars.,0
I would have ordered from this place again if the driver hadn't of scammed me for an extra dollar.  Look at your receipt!,0
"Business is closed as of the end of November 2011.  The only other ones I know of are the one near Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg and maybe the one that was in Bloomington, Il.",0
"Not the best Hilton has to offer, location is good but more than a resort this place looks like a remodeled WWII bomb bunker. Other than that service is the best, most important the beds are top notch and the food is good.",0
Worst customer service I have ever had and on top of it she was trying to argue with me....I now remember why I don't shop at target thank u..,0
Not my favorite place for Pho. I think Panda Express has better fried rice and their was a bug in my egg roll sauce. Egg rolls were over fried. They may have a good location but I will definitely go somewhere else for Pho,0
The tanning they offer is good and the place looks nice. We just found their staff to be a bit rude and I don't spend money at places where employees act that way. Not likely to visit here again.,0
Really good price for what you get.  I had the tuna bowl it was really yummy.  I have to come back and try dinner one day.,0
I like visiting ethnic stores and being amused with authentic foods they carry. Fujiya Market is small grocery with Japanese foods and bright (tacky?) magazines. It has little Japanese community corner. Worth a visit.,0
Was a bummer to see that my hot food was microwaved in front of me.  Aside from that their cold sandwiches and wraps are tasty,0
"They made us wait 15min for a table, but there are at least 8 tables empty and set for seating right next to the waiting area. Bad servoce",0
"The worst! If I could rate a zero I would. This gym is always dirty, and equipment is either broken or outdated. Avoid this location.",0
I never have anything to complain about with breakfast here! The good eggs benedict is always yummy and quick to order. They even have a 10% off club if you sign up via text at your table.,0
"Ordered sweet and sour chicken and pork fried rice.  Neither was good, we threw it out.  My husband did like the egg drop soup.",0
Good pizza and wings at a good price. Can't really go wrong with Famous Rays,0
"The norm, food is so so....not my first choice!  I have honestly given this restaurant chain a burger taste. Simply can't go back...maybe they have other decent food but for burgers, ah I can forget it!!",0
Terrible service! I sat for 30 minutes watching people with appointments get served. No problem with them honoring appointments. Big problem with not communicating that they are booked and the wait time would be 1+ hour!,0
The Thai dishes are good but the Chinese dishes are average.,0
"Very friendly, great color selection and very accommodating if you don't like your polish color after all! Good price, too. Recommend!!",0
Lovely staff; great hair stylists. Love it!,0
Excellent barbecue. The meat has a smoky flavor. Nice country atmosphere,0
Great airport. You can gamble while u wait.,0
Peter and I breakfasting after our sunny side up desert ride at the good egg. Our eggspectations were exceeded by our eggstra special attention and service from Candace and Julie.,0
The sweet and sour sauce wasnt warm. I like it warm.,0
"I usually go for their dairy products like gallons of milk, eggs, and yogurts.  Friendly staffs and helpful employees.",0
This store really needs to work on customer service.  I have been there a few times and the employees are just rude.,0
Number 2 super sonic double cheeseburger with extra mustard. Tots and my favorite strawberry slush. This sonic never gets it wrong. Very friendly staff and quick service too.,0
I tried this place for a late lunch today and all I can say it was very bland. The staff was great but the food....well not so much.,0
"I dont care what anyone says, this is by far the best Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food ever. I have not been able to find anything to compare. I wish I still lived in Pgh!",0
"We don't visit CKF very often, simply because it's very overpriced and crowded.  I do love their Chicken Piccata and macaroni cheese bites though.  They have a very large menu....at times overwhelming.",0
"Great for whatever fabric needs you might have! If you can't find it at Joann's or Hobby Lobby or you need a higher quality fabric or embellishment, Heddy's is your place.",0
So easy to work with! Robert and his staff were professional and made our wedding that much more memorable. The food was amazing and the cake was the best I've ever tasted!,0
I had never been here before and the barista helped me pick an Amazing iced caramel soy latte. It was delicious and he was super friendly. The atmosphere carries good tunes and a cool casual atmosphere. :).,0
Love the breakfast at Randy's!  Always delicious and the best service ever!  Do more events like breakfast with the birds! That was awesome!,0
Morgan was great best breakfast in cave creek. Harolds is a lot of fun at night and always a good time,0
Went for dinner and food was not good.,0
Love the staff members! Especially Bartender's Tim and John!,0

good pizza. even better drinks. better service. cool place to hang out on weekends with some buddies.,0
"Good food, nice service.more hidden menu on the wall,you have to check or ask the server.",0
"Really good food!!!! I'm so stuffed! Excellent service, the pork sandwiches we had were terrific & very BIG.Their sauce is good too. We'll definitely be back.",0
Even though we had a reservation we were made to wait for a car. If they're going to overbook cars they should offer free upgrades to get people on the road. I'd look elsewhere.,0
"Amazing place with many choices~ if you are around this area, definitely stop by and get some fresh fruit as well",0
"Let's see, $40 for crab legs that aren't fresh.  I thought I was at Red Lobster.  Won't be going back.",0
"Excellent location of the hotel. Near metro, near Phoenix  blvd with world famous stars. The cost corresponds to the quality. Near many good restaurants where you can eat tasty and inexpensive. From the window is visible inscription \""Phoenix\""",0
"Small portions compared to the rest of the asian places on green st, especially when the price is almost the same. The food is good though.",0
"Well, at least it's cheap. Hot Wok serves a purpose... It makes food court Chinese seem gourmet by comparison. Best part? You don't need to get out of your car.",0
The hostess service is great. The waitress service is very poor. Had to ask twice for water. we were ignored and mocked.,0
"Yeah, food looks to be ok.  But I didn't fly 2500 miles to eat loco moco and saimin.  Don't get me started on the oxtail soup at the Cal.",0
"This is a nice place to get Chinese food delivered from. I've had better and I've had worse, but the thing I like about this place is it's consistently good for a nice price.",0
"Mediocre, forgettable experience. We ordered pineapple fried rice, pad thai and something else I can't recall. One note flavor in all the dishes. I've had better Thai in a mall food court.",0
"Thanks for the service, or lack thereof. Customer service sucked. Not one person offered to help, and yes, it was slow.",0
"Quick friendly service.  These guys actually want you to get the cheapest price with the best coverage.  Imagine that, from an insurance person?",0
Terrible. I drove all the way to Matthews from Huntersville for pants that they said were in stock. I'm extremely disappointed that they were NOT. Thanks for wasting my time with inaccurate stock counts Old Navy!,0
Delicious vegetarian options that will nonetheless satisfy a non-veggie. Proximity to A Woman's Touch makes it the ideal place to stop in for crab cakes after a vibrator purchase.,0
I used to love this place. This last visit I never got a chance to eat. Waited 30 minutes for a small pizza that never came. Not one word from the staff about any kind of delay either,0
"I hate that they don't carry good gluten free bread. I have to go to Whole Foods in town instead. Otherwise, good selection of frozen foods.",0
"My new favorite off the strip casino. Has it all, good food, bowling, movies...",0
It's your average Taco Bell.  The location is convenient for work and price is affordable for an inexpensive lunch.  Great service and the food tasted really good.,0
Great men's pedicure! New massage chairs and great tlc on my feet.,0
Just saw the sign today. Borders on Mill is closing.. It's soon to be a ghost town around here. (But they are having a huge book sale so get em while they last).,0
Always a very good quanity of trucks to choose from. Quickly get you out and checked in.,0
This place is very affordable but the food is nothing special. It's relaxed place and is kid friendly. Cash only!!!,0
pouched eggs are totally raw eggs. Long long waiting time for breakfast after beverages. Served obviously rotten strawberry.,0
They do a pretty good job for Arizona for New York style pizza. Have a good lunch special for $6 includes two slices with any toppings and a drink. $6.90 out the door,0
Fantastic food. Great atmosphere and service.  I forgot to ask what wine the waitress brought me but I really liked it. I will defiantly come back.,0
The guy working the bar area was great. He was courteous and genuine. The food was good.,0
Had my greek letters embroidered on a couple of my own personal items. Good service.,0
"Great thin crust pizza, good local brews on tap. Would have given this another star if it wasn't for the 90 min wait for a table.",0
Worst Italian food ever. Rude waiter. Decore very lame. Room full because of coupon customers. I don't know where other reviewers have gone but don't listen to them! Stay away.,0
After pulling an all-nighter from studying for finals I decided to reward myself with a raisin bran muffin. Thank the heavens they were open very early :),0
"What can I say...I like it. When friends are saying Ihop or even worse, Dennys; thien this place is a Godsend for breakfast. Mimis is like Ihops VIP room.",0
"Just ok...the atmosphere was extremely dated, but the happy hour prices were good enough to give this place 3 stars!",0
"Nice antiquey (if thats a word) atmosphere, tons of tv's and a huge bar.  Would visit again!",0
Excellent service & food.  It is my first choice for sushi.,0
There isn't a bad thing I can say about Vito's.  It's one of my wife's and I favorite establishment.  Everything is done well and the service is top notch.  I would not hesitate to recommend this place.,0
"Everything was wonderful.  Had my birthday dinner here, party of 20. The staff were accommodating,  Mark was attentive and the food.. yum.com. Love dining here!",0
VERY nice store! More helpful and knowledgeable than most stores.,0
dollar cones on tuesday and wednesday.. can't beat it!,0
"I want to like it. I really do. I've been twice, but each time I found the dishes bland... or with a spiciness that was just spice, not flavor.",0
My 12 year old daughter and I just returned from this location and we both got very sick.  She had the orange chicken and me the Pad Thai w chicken.  Gross,0
"The food was delivered fast and it wasn't bad.  Unfortunately, it wasn't what I ordered and the staff seemed more interested in getting things done quickly that correctly.",0
Said was open at 4. Went to the bar around 415  and wasn't opened. Pretty disappointed.,0
Kinda shady and is totally dead till way late...,0
"Definitely not a 3-star hotel. Barely a 2-star hotel based on my other multiple experiences staying in Vegas... Quite disappointed at the room cleanliness, quality of furniture, location. Everything looks old and depressing.",0
"Best green chili pork in Arizona. Tender, tasty and no fat.",0
I just expect so much more in wings especially when the place is named after it. Can't really say anything about the food. Never impressed. The beer is cold and great for watching Football.,0
Service was poor.  Unfriendly atmosphere. Left before we could try food.  Very disappointed.,0
This was the only place in town where I could find a steel rim in stock. They also had the best price as well. Excellent customer service. Great place overall. I will be buying my tires here from now on.,0
$114 for a dozen Valentines day roses with thorns still on and a balloon!! Enough said.,0
Seriously why are you here looking at the reviews and not there eating? Go.. now.. do not turn around and dont look for other places.. just go.,0
These pretzels are a guilty pleasure once in awhile when I go to the mall-- yum!  Their lemonade is pretty disappointing though. Way too tart!,0
Fun college bar.  This is the place to go see girls dancing on the bar.  Top 40 music.,0
I've been going to plasma for a few years now met some amazing friends. This place is really awesome! It really is the gay Cheers!,0
"Very unimpressed. Salad was stale and drenched with dressing, wings were gross. Not going back.",0
Awesome wings and they're 50 cents during all Pen's games,0
It was ok.  Not as fancy as it sounded on the website.  The service was decent.  I would have figured the server would have asked what wine I'd like with my steak but the subject never came up.,0
"Just moved into the area and we have tried Taco Feliz twice so far. The food is Very Good!  Carnitas Tacos, Chili Rellano,, Carnitas Burrito! Yummy!",0
The pharmacy staff is the best. They remember you and do what they can to help if there are problems. Pearl and Wayne (pharmacist) and some of the best people.,0
Great place to read or just have a break from the day. Large bay doors are great for letting in sun and fresh air. Typical price range of Starbucks or Caribou with a similar layout as well.,0
"Terrible, terrible service.  sloppy work - uneven filing, polish uneven.  impersonal and rude service.  Will not go back.",0
Quick friendly service. The place is a little tight bit the coffee and omelette were great. We will for sure be back,0
"Rather pricey. 1 round of drinks and 3 sushi rolls came to over $70 before tax/tip for only two people. Service was just okay. Happy hour ends early, at 5:00 PM.",0
"Really fast service, no problem customizing dishes to different dietary needs or tastes.  Beet salad and lobster fettucini were favorites.",0
"a little pricey, but their chili is the best in the city.  Lunch specials are always a welcome treat as well.\n\nTry to make it here at least once in a while.",0
Very dated but clean. Fine for a one night stop on road trip. Free coffee in morning & cookies at night. Bathroom tiny!,0
Great service. Great food and never ending sodas.,0
Thought I would give them a 2nd chance... Bad idea! Employees make you feel like your putting them out for ordering overpriced pizza. this place will be out of business If  the owners don't  make a change quickly.,0
Had their pizza again recently and I liked it better than the first time.  This place is great when I'm in the mood for pizza with a bit of a thicker and crispier crust.  Their pasta dishes sound awesome too.,0
"Would not use as a shipping service, they are extremely slow to process even if there is no one in line. Makes even the post office look good.",0
Super friendly staff with down to earth Show Casts!!! Brett was kind and took pictures with everyone there and took the time to talk to my kids. Amazing!!!,0
"Ick, Sorry, I did give you 2 stars for politeness.  Food was awful!!",0
"amazing selection of frames,very friendly staff,great service, i will be back for my next pair of glasses",0
Too many birds on the back patio.  It's to bad because the view is wonderful.,0
Where everyone knows your name.   Local bar was a great view of the ice rink.  And pages of beers to pick from.,0
Party of 10 for happy hour. Was asked to move entire party to the other side of the restaurant. Then was asked to pay the $328 bill and leave bc there was a wait for seating! Will never return!,0
"Pretty good food,  the selection was great the service was a bit slow and I had to seat my family my self but overall it was ok, all day every day 99 cent margaritas.",0
Attention KMart Bosses. Perhaps management will realize that they need more then 3 registers open on any given day,0
"Shrimp portofino was good, but a little on the bland side. It need a little more sauce or salt. Free bread is always good! Caesar salad was ok not anything to write home about.",0
I took a few corporate colleagues from San Jose California here one night for dinner.  The food was good.  It was a bit loud though.,0
Always enjoyed this Chipotle location. One thing about Chipotle that you never forget is how clean the restaurant is.... Also the enormous burritos :),0
great place they help me almost everything that  i had to replace,0
Love the food! Amazing server. Egg rolls slightly greasy tho. Long wait but it was Valentine's night. Love the 3 course dinner for 2 they offer.,0
closed due to the roof collapsed during a monsoon rain,0
"As someone in their twenties, I seriously enjoyed coming here! It completely exceeded my expectations. This museum is a must when visiting Charlotte, especially if you have small children. It's a one of a kind place indeed.",0
"It's OK.  As my wife says, we wouldn't go out of our way to eat here.  However, when in the area, it is an option.",0
Crappy service. Major cross contamination. Inattentive staff. Do yourself a favor and go someplace else.,0
"This place is awesome! Great ambience, friendly staff, and great food and beer. This was a phenomenal first experience, an I will be back.",0
If you are driving through Florence you must stop in and grab a bite to eat. Large outside patio with smoking and a great view.,0
Avoid this McDonald at all cost they have the worse staff and the food is disgusting sloppy and will make you sick. I hate this place it's too bad I like mcdonalds food,0
"I used to love Paradise Bakery. They had such good salads. But the last few times I've eaten there I noticed their food has gone way downhill. It's so bad, I won't be eating there again. Too bad :(",0
Pancakes were really good.\nBreakfast potatoes were just okay.\n\nWouldn't go out of my way to eat here but it wasn't bad either.,0
"Meh.  Overpriced, mediocre food and drinks. Staff is rude.  Many rave about this place.  Why?  The one star for the outdoor decor.",0
They are going through a remodeling phase right now so the atmosphere is kinda weird. And the food never looks like the pictures!!,0
"Awesome. Was greeted when we came in, the staff & the owner Daddy Ron was very attentive and friendly!",0
"It's a nice hotel for what it is. Cheap!\n\nRoom was decent, had a clean shower and refrigerator. \n\nBed was soft. What else could you ask for?!",0
"Great food.  Great service.  Great people.  Great Value.\nBest sausage, peppers and onions around!",0
"Not exactly an upscale mall by a long shot.  Service is horrendous and it is crowded and messy, with a poor selection of low grade stores.",0
It's was good they didn't have ground beef but whatever my taco salad was still good... The prince was awesome for the amount I got.,0
"I love you Phoenix Comicon, see you next year!",0
We have been here several times.  Service and food has always been quality for the price.,0
"The \""Hot\"" wings have a delicious & spicy flavor. The burgers are awesome (I recommend adding green chile to the cheeseburger). But I highly recommend the California Dreamin grilled Chicken sandwich with grilled bacon and fresh avocado, fantastic!",0
This is the most friendly and affordable nail salon ive been to! The owners are sweet and their massage chairs are fantastic! I highly recomend this place.,0
Food was ok. Big portions but way to pricy for the food quality. I did get sick after having their salmon. Not sure if it was the mic of foods or what. Most likely not going again,0
"This is my favorite place for Japanese food. The prices are reasonable, the service is great and the food is wonderful!",0
My burger looked like someone sat on it. Hot mess y'all.,0
"Today is the re-grand opening, a shaky start, but things are moving forward, lots of management presence. Place looks better staff very outgoing food is amazing!!",0
Love it! such good deals and really good prices on costume jewelry. I've been a fan for years!,0
Nice staff but the good was not good. I could get the same thing at grocery store.,0
The food was really good. But what is good food with bad service. Your spending a lot of money there for the waitress to ignore you. Maybe someone should tell them they get bigger tips if you're more attentive to your customers.,0
To call this fish and chips is SOOO wrong.  Its nothing like fish and chips should be.  Go to George and Dragon in Phoenix if you want real fish and chips.  Greasy squares of fish is disgusting.,0
"Every time we visit Arizona we always go to Tom's. There Italian Beef is fantastic with peppers and grilled onions, makes my mouth water just thinking about it. We also had there Vienna hotdogs there great as well.",0
"Nice place, but in a professional environment I don't really want to see employees who wear their pants below their ass. I won't be going back there.",0
"Terrible. Long wait, food was a mess and unappealing. One of the worst places I've been.",0

"The orange chicken is very popular with my coworkers. In fact, some would eat there everyday if they could. I think their food is mediocre at best although they give very large portions and their service is very, very fast.",0
Lisa and Sam in the service department were GREAT!!!  They helped us out that words can't even describe.  Thank you SO much!!!!,0
Best Chinese in Phoenix hands down. The hot and spicy prawns are a must and so are the house chow fun noodles.,0
"Good breakfast.  Food portions were good and tasty.  Good breakfast place, staff was very friendly.  Very \""family\"" friendly.  Good spot for breakfast on a sunday.",0
"Good product selection.  They didn't have the brand of hair that I use for braiding, hence 3 stars.",0
Great place to salsa dance on a Saturday night!!  A brief lesson is given by some great professionals-check it out!!,0
"The \""Big Rig\"" Pasta calls my name more often than I'd like. Living close to this much delicious pasta and deep dish pizza is rough on the waist line. Always great service, especially outside at the bar.",0
"The broadway pizza is yummy. The knots are a cheap yummy eat. $3 for 6 knots cheap, cheap!",0
"So dinner was filet & lobster, asparagus, mushrooms, wedge salad and sweet potato with fresh brewed coffee.  Outback has remarkable servers, delicious food and unbelievable customer service.  No worries mate - best steak in south Charlotte",0
Just found my new fav Mexican restaurant.  The atmosphere is really great.  The food is amazing.  Chips and salsa are fantabulous.  Drinks are good prices.,0
This is a great place to eat! The people there are so nice and the food is fantastic. They have some of the best cornbread I've had and the catfish and chicken are fried to golden perfection but deliciously moist.,0
All those people that claim Mike Ferry is hard ass about taking your money are right. He is old school flim flam man. Gets you to sign a contract and takes your blood. Stay away IMO.,0
"Not a bad place to day drink, but that's about it. I've eaten here a number of times and it has always left something to be desired. Food is very average.",0
"The food was pretty good, But service was pretty bad. There were two waiters and about 4 tables but we had to wait almost half an hour to get a to go box and the check for some reason.",0
Worst pharmacy service ever! Messed up my prescription several times this year already.,0
"Great local bar, amazing drink specials, lots of sports memorabilia, plenty of TV's and the Best wings I have had in Arizona (Get em Grilled).",0
I've been taking my family & friends here for over twenty years. Authentic food that hasn't changed. Quality control is very high. It's great every time we go.,0
"So ingredients were pretty fresh for the salad.  I wish the eggs weren't all crumpled (probably the wrong word) together.  Overall for all you can eat and $7, it was pretty good.",0
This is not good pizza.\n\nveggi toppings were on the old side,0
"Not my Macado's I remember in Boone,NC.  Place was empty and food took awhile to come out.",0
Called several companies and this was the lowest quote by far. Setting up the install was easy and Chris from True View did a great job!,0
"A great after work hangout, it gets pretty loud in there. Fine brewery has at times very good food, tvs, and service. I've been there so many times I've worn it out.",0
"Good location,average food, but too expensive. Drink service is slow. Entertainment is spotty. Should double the bar size and delete dining room",0
"Great service, nice environment, big ticket pricing for good food. No negatives. Not my favorite.",0
"Sure enough Just like the other reviewers said, they will try to over charge for everything and upgrade you the insurance without your approval. Read your contract before you agree to it. Thieves!",0
This place is a true gem in Vegas!  Definitely make a trip north to enjoy the history of this town through these fantastic Neon signs.  The staff is extremely knowledgeable and you will leave with a new appreciation for Sin City!,0
"The staff at the Squirrel Hill branch are incredibly friendly, and the library is always clean and organized.",0
A chain restaurant with average food those I ldo love their ribs.  The staff there was awesome!  I would definitely go back.,0

The airport was easy to navigate and clean. no gum on the floor. had to rock my jacket as the airport had some kicking AC going on. the people were nice,0
"Overpriced and slow service. Great selections in freshwater but go online if you can, it will save you time and money",0
My current favorite. I'll leave room for improvement. White pizza is phenom.,0
Super duper helpful folks!  And close to the house.  Who needs the depot?  Not I.,0
You're a coffeehouse.  You charge almost $2.50 for a cup of coffee.  It should not taste like Maxwell House that was brewed seven hours ago.  Period.,0
I think there was no planning when this airport was built. No sense of direction on where to go and its like it takes forever to get to the bagage claim. It's just plain ugly.,0
Very slow internet.. Bathrooms need a remodel.  Well below average quality for a Marriott property with above average price.,0
This was one of first pizza places that I've tried inPittsburgh. It was about 5 years ago. I don't have a clear memory of that time but I have Parma pizza phobia ever since... So go figure...,0
"New to the area and have ordered from them twice. The pizza is good, but overpriced, in my opinion. Everyone raves about the garlic knots...they were good, not great, just good.",0
Great firework show for the military appreciation game. The venue was clean and people were friendly and helpful.,0
I've been here a few times as well as ordered out and it's been good all around. Wings and pizza are their specialty and I stick to both. Always good.,0
Chicken was very dry and ribs were chewy. Slaw was watered down and fries tasted old.,0
Fairly average Italian food other than the meatballs. Too many good Italian places in Pittsburgh to choose here. Interior could use an update. Beer selection below average and nothing special happening with speciality drinks.,0
"The first time I've regretted my bariatric surgery. Seriously the food was amazing, the staff polite, and the new restaurant was gorgeous. I only wish I could have enjoyed more food there.",0
"4 stars for this Glendale Chinese food. If there are better places in Glendale, please tell me. I love coming here with my mom when I am in town, the chicken lo-mein lunch special makes me happy.",0
This place didn't have the authentic taste I was looking for. The atmosphere is nice but the food quality was lacking.,0
worst service I've ever encountered. food isn't bad but would never recommend this place due to the disorganized staff and the insanely long waits for everything.,0
"Came here for brunch and wasn't impressed with the selection on the menu, ordered the scrambled eggs which were OK.  I will go back to try dinner at some point but I am not in a rush.",0
"Always a great spot to grab lunch, and contrary to what I've heard, you don't have to be LDS to eat there. J/K.  Great lunch specials!",0
"I'm a regular at this establishment, and always been treated with respect and kindness, great costumer service.",0
"Good biscuits and gravy and pretty good omelettes.  The ranch potatoes weren't very good, not sure if the hashbrowns are better.  Either way it's a good breakfast for the price.",0
Had lunch here today! Very good experience. Considering they were super busy for the rush. Got my food in a reasonable amount of time. And it was cooked to perfection!,0
The only full service car wash near my house.  Same price as all the others.  Little slow but there was great attention to detail.  Nice job.,0
"HORRIBLE FOOD. My chicken sandwich tasted like rubber, the curly fries weren't cooked enough, and the wings were mediocre. \n\nStop supporting horrible chains like this and they will all go away.",0
"Quick to be seated.  Good service.   Best food that I've had on this trip, but not so amazing that I have to come back.",0
"Absolutely love the food here, but unfortunately they don't take to go orders. I called this morning and the lady refused to let me place an order. It's the 21st century get with the program.",0
"This store is not for me, most of those clothes here is all the clothes no one would ever want at a big discounted price.",0
Love the store.  But the parking is a nightmare (but that is the fault of the patrons with more money than brains who can't drive or park there cars).,0
It's been a while since we've been here... They no longer have the onion rings on the menu? What is the world coming to??,0
"I would of gave it one more star,but there was something floating in my drink.",0
"SWA usually has great service, but the proprietary machine oriented culture of Vegas has rubbed off a bit at this airport.  And while the flights and inboard service is typically great, the airport service has some local coolness.",0
Much better than streets of New York and there wings are the best I go there all the time,0
Cool airport. Slot machines are convenient. Security is friendly and good lounge and food selections.,0
"This place is awesome! These guys are friendly and know their stuff. They have a lot of great beers on hand and make great recommendations. Plus, they have a drive-thru and a cat for a mascot! How cool is that?",0
My husband and kids really liked this place. The hot dogs and chili cheese fries are great!,0
Food was terrible - service was good - prices have been raised twice in the past 6 months - now over priced -  no happy hour  but love the golf course -,0
Cute museum. Really hot in the desert. Cool history lesson of how the Hohokam Indians lived back in the day.,0
"Never been treated so unprofessionally in my life. Worst customer service, ever.",0
Just a run of the mill Subway. Ate there last week and noticed a good size cockroach run under the chip rack.\n\nI don't think I will be back...,0
Pretty good. Buffet is decent. Nothing exceptional,0
great food for a great price.  and the people are so awesome.  new location same good food.,0
"I'm.2 miles away from them, just on the other side of the freeway and they refused a delivery. Just take the delivery sign off your window!!!!",0
"Very nice place to eat! Friendly device, great food, and nice background music! Keep it up!!!",0
"#39 = AMAZING. The Thai Tea is also amazing!!  Yes the place is usually not full, but don't let that scare you.  Love this place.",0
Poor customers service.  They will take an hour to come and pick you up or send you a cab that is smaller than your request.  Basically they suck,0
Very diverse Asian menu!  If you have a hang over go for the Fo!,0
Great happy hour prices on weekdays and friendly staff. Food is what you'd expect from an Applebee's.,0
"P.P.S. The 1.99/lb HatchChile Special has ended, Like GirlScoutCookies, VidaliaOnions, et cetera,  et cetera. Never long enough......",0
Had delivery last night and it was TERRIBLE!\nI threw the menu away,0
"When it is blazing hot in Phoenix, get a ice cold beverage which they have lots of.  One block away from the office I work in when I go to Phoenix so it is pretty sweet.",0
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! It has fast service and super great food. I've been to other pho joints but their pho broth doesn't even compare. Also they give hugh sides of all the extras that go in the soup.,0
"This airport now looks pretty neat.\nI like the simple interiors.\n\nThe slot machines on your way out seem kinda tacky but hey, this is Vegas.",0
Oh my god SOO slow!!!! I've been in line at the drive thru for 10 minutes for a Frisco Burger and there are still two cars in front of me!!,0
Brought several sweaters and a jacket to them to get dry cleaned and I was very disappointed in the job.  I was actually unsure whether they had actually dry cleaned anything and had to take all the clothes to another place.,0
The service here is amazing and the food is equally as amazing. The staff is friendly and the space is comfortable. A great place to eat!,0
"this is a great salon to change your hair style!\n\nif you need a trim or your split ends cut, it is far too pricy!",0
I had more fun at the Arizona State Fair and paid a lot less.\n\nThat about sums it up!,0
"Cheap breakfast that is mediocre.  The service is mediocre.  The bathroom is stinky, I had to hold my breathe.",0
Fish fry was over cooked and greasy. People seem to like it here so maybe I just had it on a bad day.,0

"Great pizza wait for it......when your near broke or drunk or both. And it is open late on weekends, always a plus.",0
Its awesome to finally find a 24 hr Mexican food joint! It did take a long time to get my food but it was well worth the wait.,0
Excellent food and service.For a great steak you sure can't beat the road house. \nAnd the service is also great every time I come here.,0
"Food is delicious, good prices and nice people. Perfect combination...",0
Good food.  Good service.  Bad location.  Bad hoodlums in the strip mall where it is located.,0
Solid Chinese restaurant.  I always get the Egg Moo-shu and it is amazing. Definitely would recommend Hong Kong Cafe.,0
Food is always made fresh and I have never had to wait too long.  Good place to come for lunch if you work in the area.,0
"The place I tried was on union hills, absolutely terrible..pizza was over done, wings were bad and I felt like a fool spending $30.00 there for a terrible product.",0
Ox tail soup special after 11pm. market Street Cafe.,0
"This place is just \""meh\"".  Sure it's pretty cheap and the people that work there are nice and helpful but in a city with so much more to offer, it just didn't do it for me.",0
Poor service they told me the wrong date to come in.,0
Just wonderful! I love the coffee here. The atmosphere is war and friendly. A lot of friendly people hanging out.,0
The staff argues with the customer about bad tasting ice cream. When I asked for a replacement it was an argument an all I wanted was it switched out. I wasn't trying to get anything free.,0
"Ok pizza, rude staff.  Not a fan and won't return!",0
Just ordered 5 pies for Thanksgiving. TERRIBLE!!! Crusts were so thick and raw. Pecan pie filling was so chewy it had to be thrown away! They have lost a lifelong customer! Mary Hedges,0
A tad on the high end but what a view!!!! Food was wonderful and the staff was friendly. Well worth the extra money,0
This place is always very busy at lunch time and I dont understand. They serve high priced super lame cafeteria food. This falls just below fussali for the worst dining option at park central.,0
"What a bad deal, stale fries under cooked onion rings and an absence of service.  There's even a charge for to go orders. Save your $20 go elsewhere.",0
"ok prices, barely ok food, works in a pinch.",0
What a great event.  A great place to look at cars and people.  Try to get into the opening night gala for a real treat.,0
Had the California burrito here. It was a burrito with French fries inside that was unique. Nothing outstanding but nice to mix it up if your tired of the average burrito.,0
"Note that the shop is not in the strip mall but in a building in the parking lot of the strip mall.  Also, closed on the weeknight I was there.",0
"Food was good. Nothing fancy, but it is lower priced and you get what you pay for. Great service...waiter made an effort to keep us entertained.",0
"the sun shines again when i eat a rito's green chili burrito, and double rainbows appear when i eat the tacos.",0
"One of the better sushi restaurants in Phoenix.  I have had good experiences dining there, except one time they over-charged me.",0
"Clean and organized, found some cheap items that I was looking for.",0
"I love coming to this blimpies. Cal, Neil and the rest of the staff are so sweet and the food is always amazing. Wayy better than subway.",0
Food was great. Host staff was great. Server was too anxious to go home. Texting and side work was more important than serving our table. Overall was good though.,0
"The lobby is nice and the pool, fitness room are good. Some floors look a bit dated although rooms are just like other Sheratons.",0
Love it here. Never had a bad meal. I've celebrated every major event of my life here so far lol. Really good here. Service is excellent. Just watch out for this one particular guy that I won't name. :},0
The most low-rent taco bell i ever been to,0
"Finally the nail salon i can come back!! Clean and spacious salon, painless procedure (whew!) and great selections of opi. Thank you, Christina.",0
"Having lived in Germany for 7 years, this is one of the few places where I have found good German food in the US. I would rate it 5 stars, but they really could improve on the service.",0
Great lunch specials! The best green tea ever! Love this place. Always great fast service.,0
Great food and great prices!! My favorite is the green curry.,0
Will never come to this place again. Don't even bother doing punch cards because the old lady will find an excuse to say is not valid.,0
"The service was friendly, helpful, and the food and drinks were perfect. Cathy was extremely helpful with menu navigation. I will definitely visit again soon:]",0
This place is disgusting its so dirty and all the food was dried out and I got a salad and there was a huge hair in it I've never had a good experience here its over priced for mediocre food,0
So I went here bcuz my car was running hot they were nice.checkd it out and had me on my way n lil over an hr,0
"A fairly decent Walgreens. This location did not carry as many items I have found in others, but everything was organized and clean. The employees were helpful and friendly.",0
"This place surprised me. The bar is huge, they have pool tables, and the atmosphere is laid back. Will return.",0
"OK airport. Layout is fine - food choices vary across terminals; in mine, not great choices. Clean & bright. Conveniently located to suburbs around Phoenix. It works -",0
Harkins is always fun to go to.  I like them better than AMC and they always seem to have a friendly staff.  Thanks Harkins for being there for me :),0
"Love love love Cielo! Super clean, staff is so friendly! Penny does amazing hair!! & Chris is awesome @ waxing! I live across town but well worth the drive! Wouldn't go any where else!!",0
"The Nugget is probably my favorite place to stay, why? because it cost as much as the Concha Inn but has the style and class of any hotel on the strip. In terms of comfort and style, I consider the cost inexpensive.",0
They got me in and out quickly for my appointment at the Genius Bar.  Unfortunately when I got home I realized the problem I came in for hadn't been solved.,0
"Despite the atmosphere (not too inviting), and unfortunately the slow service, the food was actually good.  This appears pretty consistent as I read the reviews before trying it out with the family.",0
The office staff is friendly but don't return calls. There are unnecessary fees for paying rent online and the maintenance department is rude and they refuse to fix issues properly.,0
"Service was a little slow, the tacos were delicious. \n\nWhat my girlfriend complained about: the guacamole had too many onions. Slow service.",0
Paid $1100 for the required course - party of 6 - and unfortunately did not come close to feeling satisfied in any regard - sorry guys - not a fan and way overpriced,0
Can't do all you can eat by yourself. Seems unfair to pay more for just a single item on the menu when I couldn't get someone to join me and get the 15.99 price.,0
Very nice steakhouse. Great ambiance. Very nice staff. Our waiter AJ was great. The food was very good. I expected my steak to be more tender. But everyone else in our large party only had good things to say.,0
"Bad experience for a first time diner looking for a neighborhood restaurant. There was no steak available for dinner and I was refused service outside, which was such a shame for a perfect arizona night. I wont be coming back again",0
Very friendly staff and very fast delivery!! If you just want to relax at home and not cook... Give them a call they will rush some great pizza and sides right to you.,0
Not a bad airport at all!\nSecurity line was much better than in the past.\nTaxi line moves quickly too!,0
"I got the salmon bagel, I asked for extra veggies and got charged for extra veggies, only to open my bagel at work and to find....... No veggies... Sigh..",0
Gotta try the Soda's. I had a great black raspberry soda with Dutch chocolate ice cream. Really an OMG Experience!,0
"This place has legit beer and good food.  The atmosphere is a little noisy, but it's a fun place that I'll definitely re-visit!",0
Great place to get awesome holiday decorations on the cheap. TONS of other things too. Brand names for 99 cents and they even have produce.,0
Your basic airport. Nothing special to get excited about.,0
"This bar is awesome. They have a great selection, everyone is incredibly friendly and down to earth. Least douchey bar I've been to in Scottsdale.",0
Had a slow leak in the right front tire. They fixed that but also checked my spare to make sure it was in good shape and had proper pressure. That was unexpected and very cool. That's why I keep coming back.,0
"The food here is OK but nothing special.  The service and ambiance are very lacking.  If I want authentic Mexican at a local Mom and Pop dive, I'd rather go to Espo's.",0
The food is lacking flavor. The Nile and Middle Eastern Cafe are the best in Madison for Middle Eastern food.,0
Awsome had the beef fried rice so good worth a shot,0
Ok crowd. Good place to see concerts. But stupid expensive drinks and the bartenders do not give very good service. I've downgraded this place to only a concert stop. And only then if there is nothing else going on.,0
Mild Mexican. Everything I expected yo be spicy was not. The Carne Asada combo was a good flavor with a top notch enchilada.,0
I gave up on Carolina Asthma and Allergy.,0
"Had a blast!  Live music,  live bull riding, great food, great service and great drinks. I love this place & totally worth the drive!",0

"Lady Di and I are still looking for the best Sports Bar in Arizona. 4th floor was very surprising. TVs are great, the pizza is amazing. I had the Rebel IPA, delicious! \nWe'll be back!!!",0
Starbucks is Starbucks is Starbucks. If it wasn't like $9 for a muffin and a smoothie I'd go here more often.,0
Went there to purchase outdoor furniture. Salesperson Brandon could not have been more helpful. When I need something for my fireplace I know where I will be going to.,0
"These guys tried to charge me 5 dollars for a battery. On amazon I found the same battery, 10 for $2.50. Don't ever go here. They are a complete rip off and they have no conscience.",0
Fast service! The order was made correctly and was delicious. Friendly staff. We had an order of 3 large pizzas and they were all good. Much better than other experiences I've had with Pizza Hut!,0
In my opinion Best Buy does not care about people in wheelchairs. Sorry I cannot shop there anymore. I been treated like dirt.,0
"I generally get the falafel for 5 bucks. Really tasty and it makes two meals. The decor is kind of weird, if it were solely a take out place I'd like it even more.",0
"Delicious. We had beef bun, spring rolls and beef ph\u00f4. Nice little place to stop for quick dinner before the movies - conveniently next door.",0
So far agree with the customer service. These guys should go find another job.,0
"good pasta! I didn't have a bad experience there. The waiters were friendly, they had good bread and if you get there for happy hour then its a great price too!",0
My quilt has the strongest chemicaly perfumey scent to it. Will update if they fix this.,0
"Dined in twice, food ok, atmosphere good.",0
If you have any sort of complaint whatsoever expect management to laugh at you and then hang up the phone.,0

This place is awesome! Food and drinks are A+,0

I am SO addicted to the vegetarian Thai dynamite. I don't think I will ever be able to order anything else. The tofu lettuce wraps are also a must EVERYTIME.,0
Been calling for the last 30 minutes to find a family member that is residing there with no answer. Not what I expect and highly disappointed.,0
This was a nice little mexican restaurantt.  Had good food.  Menus were large and plentyful.  Price was reasonable.  Staff was friendly.  Can't really complain about it.,0

Disgusting!  I'd rather eat McDonald's over this place!,0
"Over-rated, over-priced pies. The banana cream pie tasted artificial and cost 18 dollars!  Save your hard earned dollars and buy a grocery store pie. You'll feel better about your purchase!",0
The Staff is VERY rude the manager is even ruder kept talking over me then slammed the door.. stay away from this location.,0
"Not horrific, not the transcendental experience I expected based on their press, the fries were dry and floury in texture and the burger looked like it came out of a frozen pack although it was tasty.",0
Great course.  Well maintained.  The staff is great from the moment you drive up. When in Las Vegas a must play for the price.,0
"Amazing food, amazing views. Great secret date place.",0
Great Sandwiches and pub style food. This place reminds me of Cheers cause the staf is so friendly and they make you feel at home.,0
I shopped at Pottery Barn over the 2014 Holiday Season.  The selection was top of the line. The sales associates were very helpful and courteous.  Great Staff which always helps the shopping experience.,0
Pretty darn good pizza and great appetizers.  The staff was friendly and the place was clean.  I enjoyed the atmopshere.,0
Bouquet looks nothing like bouquet on website.  Has 4 scraggly stems of orchids in a glass vase.   Would not use again,0
The guys are very helpful and I have been going here for years for professional service. Great equipment selection and servicing ability,0
"Very slow service, over 55 minutes to check out. Lady did not know what she's doing.",0
Not a fan of this location. The food was subpar each time I've been.,0
Went there tonight.\n\nWorst Sushi I have ever had.,0
My brother and I ate here. He got the number 3 and I got the number 12. Both were great. And we each took home a quarter of our sandwiches because they were very big.,0
"I am now aware of the fact that they do not charge covers on the weekends...\n\nThis being the case, I could now possibly see myself dropping by for one cocktail on a Mill avenue binge session, but just one.",0
"Great customer service, friendly and helpful! They moved a year ago to Pecos Rd and Patrick, BTW.",0
"Overpriced movies and food, its your average movie theatre really.",0
Do not eat here any place that has bugs climbing in its dinning room means bugs in the kitchen. Will never ever eat the food here!,0
Make sure you're ready for NASCAR! This Hotel is as close as you may want to be from The Charlotte Motor Speedway. Get your Motor running. The staff and management are on a roll.,0
"I was pretty nervous about going here because of some of the reviews, since I've never been there before. The fees definitely suck but it really wasn't that bad, I have been to venues that were much worse.",0
Oreo donuts tasted pretty good. The baked goods did not give me an orgasm but is a little more fun than dunkin donuts,0
"Great costume store! Have rented and bought items from here and have never had any issues! The staff is great, very very helpful, and you can browse their selection from their website: http://www.easleys.com/",0
"Everything was superb.  Egg flour soup, pot stickers, orange chicken --all fantastic.  Great prompt service.",0
It looks like a nice airport. The one issue is the CAB line. Very hard to find. One of the worst i have came across,0

Can you be addicted to Panda Express? Cause I think I may have a Panda abuse problem...or I've just convinced myself that its good for me cause it's the only way I can make myself eat veggies!,0

"The largest selection of Asian and middle eastern goods in Madison. Plus, super cheap produce!",0
Great Fabric Store with Great low prices! Mostly everything is $8.99 a yard. Plus they give out great ideas and advice.,0
Love the selection. Been shopping here for years. The employees however are always rude and shouldn't even work in the public. Normally I grab what I need and get out of there fast as possible.,0
"Love this place! My wife and I come here every year for our anniversary. Everything from the food the staff, the scenery even the amenities are top notch. Highly recommended!",0
"My husband and I had our wedding reception there, and the service was terrible. My guests staying at the hotel did not like the rooms either, they could hear whats happening next door.",0
The setting is gorgeous.  The beer is good.  And the jambalaya is nice and spicy.,0
"We have eaten at Fleming's a number of times.The food is pretty good, but the service has sucked each time. We mentioned to the manager, whom was not very sincere with his response. Next time Eddie V's",0
My husband and I love having breakfast here.  Such a cute place with delicious food keeps us coming back.  The atmosphere is lively and  it's a nice way to start the day.,0
Being a valley native I have had my share of Mexican food. Sonoran is my fav and this little place does it up right. Great service and excellent red chili,0
"Service is fast and friendly. We really liked our server, who checked in with us frequently. \nThe food was good, and hot. The only thing that could be improved is that the salad had visible wilt.",0
The prices seem kind of high and variation of product seems to be low.  I like the place overall since its close.,0
"The food and service are fantastic, but the real star is the view - best spot for date night in the valley.",0
I went here because I was told they served the best mushroom cheeseburger in the area.  So that is what I ordered.  It was good but not spectacular.   Atmosphere was nothing that special but it was clean.,0
The food here is decent but certainly not worth dealing with the very condescending owner. I'd much rather take my money to a place that appreciates their customers.,0
I was pleasantly surprised with the Emergency room here. The staff was very friendly and got us in very quickly. Made a sucky experience less miserable!,0
Big turnover at this location...Looks like there is little training.\nI used them for a few months and then changed to another groomer.,0
Let's just say I feel privileged and proud to be a nursing student at this community college!,0
Went there for lunch buffet once. A cockroach was crawling on the side of the table cover I was sitting with a friend at. That's all I have to say....,0
Love this place. Used to be called Casa Bianca (along with 2 other Casa B locations in Madison which are now closed). Pizza hasn't changed since the Casa Bianca days. Big and Floppy slices. So good.,0
below average. it's acceptable for the price in LV though.,0
Nice neighborhood wine bar.  Big pours.  Not much in the way of food.,0
Great service and atmosphere.  The food is good - comfort food for the soul.,0

"The stuffed burgers they sell, awesome. Frozen cheese curds are also available here, oh yes.",0
"Wow!  It really was very, very good.  The server was a little weird but overall everything was peachy!",0
"Good burgers. Great place for a good old fashion hamburger, fries and a beer.",0
"Oddly smells like popcorn..but in that \""covering up a smell\"" bad way.",0
Seriously? I order a drink and the waitress wants me 2 finish my 1st drink so she doesn't have to make my 2nd and give me a clean glass? Alrighty Then!,0
"I go for the semi annual sale mainly, but will get coupons for free items throughout the year and stop in. The staff is always friendly and I never have to wait in line.",0
They have turned into social snobs.  My kids have been asked  (told) I do not want them to give this place any more money.  Unbelievable!!,0
"eh, no thanks!\n\nIt is just american-ized Mexican food and there is something in their cooking (spice/oils) that tends to not agree with me later so we have stopped going.",0
"saw a fly dancing on my sandwich when waiting for my order, they don't bother to pay attention anyway since there are quite a lot customers, awful awful place even though i have very good experience with other panera bread",0
"This was a bit of a disappointment. Sushi rice was way too sweet, and the pasta was overcooked. Overall food was ok but worse than I had expected given the 4 star rating and seemingly authentic menu.",0
This location of Verizon gave me the customer service experience equivalent  of a car wreck.,0
"Nice restaurant and the food was really good, but the service was horrible! Our waitress was rude, and forgot part of our order after she took forever to bring our food out",0
Just a pawn shop with expensive stuff. too much pawn stars tee shirts and junk.,0
"The staff here are all friendly and professional my favorite stylist is Chanelle she's amazing and very talented,  I recommend you go in and see her. Salon is very clean.",0

"While the food is not too great here, the company does business with a crooked valet service",0
Great food and atmosphere.  Very upscale and friendly.  Favorite is the kick-ass filet for dinner.  Great lunch specials too.,0
I don't often go with my boys to the strip clubs nearer downtown and this place is why! Horrible and smelled really bad. There was one nice girl there n wish I could remember her name. The 2 stars are for her!,0
Good food. Much better than your standard pub grub. The garlic bread is especially awesome. Nice wait staff and a few TVs to watch.,0
"My wife and I love this place.  The Modern Life dealer, who has 3 booths is probably our favorite in the bunch, however we have found a lot of great mid century modern pieces here at great prices.",0
I've been here twice.  Food is adequate but definitely not the best.  Service is very slow.  You spend your whole lunch break standing in line.  I won't go back.,0
Monster Framing & Art Gallery really helped me make the right choice for a romantic gift.  These guys are really knowledgeable about all the different options for custom framing and were very patient in helping me create the perfect gift.,0
"After reading the reviews that the food was so food we ordered a pizza.  It was greasy, very salty and the order was wrong.  Will not go back.",0
It is the typical old school sonoran mexican joint. Nothing wowed me. Tamale was close to hormel from a can. Taco was good.,0
"Food was good, unfortunately, many in my party was not feeling good the next day.  Not accusing this place of food poisoning, but it did have a negative affect on most of us that ate there.",0
I am a big fan of this place. They take great care of you and have awonderful breakfast buffet for networking groups. Nice people and clean place.,0
"I have always wanted to try this place we don't have any in Florida. My thoughts is jack can stay I the box. It only got a star cause you have to do something. The food was awful, nasty just no!!",0
"It sucks to see all these negative comments about this place! I'm a huge fan of the show, it's kinda bogus that you don't see Corey, chumlee, or Rick in the shop",0
The Saimin was really good. Get there early to avoid the long line.,0
"Riprama, ordered pad thai, lors of noodles, very little chicken,.and ONE shrimp, first an last time there!!",0
"Great Classic Burger and an old time diner feel! Can be a bit inconsistent with over cooking the patties at times, but overall great job.  Love the unique chili and egg toppings and choice of skinny or fat fries.",0
Food was just OK. My wife and I both had chimmi's enchilada style but they didn't deep fry them so they where really enchilada burritos. My black beans where also under cooked.,0
They've got boys' clothes.  They've got girls' clothes.,0
One of my all time favorite restaurants. Bruschetta is amazing!,0
"We stayed 3 nights and the place was empty for the most part.  It's starting to look a bit tattered, unkept.",0
"This. Place. Sucks. The food is bad, the waitresses are nasty (and they suck at their job), it's full of a bunch of overweight degenerates in NASCAR shirts... Just bad all the way around.",0
Very good honest burger 2nd time here and got great burgers each time.  Fast and a great value.  Looking forward to trying their breakfast burrito soon.,0
The food is of poor quality. The crust is close to cardboard. The salad did not taste good. The server asked us if we wanted more drinks and and we had to ask again to get them. We won't be returning.,0
Lets just say that they are the reason I don't eat Chinese food anymore.  There was a hair in my cum like sauce. barf...  I can't do it anymore.,0
"A very consistant pool bar with great pizza. My family loved the atmosphere, design, food, and staff. You get exactly what you can expect, that's 5 stars in my book.",0
The steak rolls are good but not worth the price,0
Unfortunately overpriced for the quality of the food. I feel like you could have the same items at another restaurant that is less stuffy and old-school than this place.,0
"Loudest A/C unit ever!! Loudest people by the pool at midnight. And only 1 treadmill in the gym worked. Not impressed, but my room was clean(despite my do not disturb sign being left on the door).",0
"well, the place looks legit from the outside......",0
They have some good sales from time to time. Watch the sale prices and make sure your getting the best deal. The one thing that keeps this from a 4 star review is the store you do not get cell phone reception in the store.,0
Great for kids haircuts. Terrible for adults. Never going again,0
If you are seeking quantity and not quality Marigold should be consideration. Potatoes were burned to a crisp and eggs were not cooked fully. Better choices in Madison,0
"This was an ok place to grab a quick bite, but it appears they have closed down and are no longer in business.",0
This place is still open because the snowbirds don't know what real Mexican food is all aabout and there is no where else in AJ to eat.  If you have a car there is no reason to eat here at all.,0
Attended a beautiful baby shower in the Hacienda. Wait staff was on point. The menu options were fresh and delicious. I highly recommend the grilled vegetable chopped salad.,0
I am very meticulous about my hair. Supercuts was the best I have had in years. Highly recommended!,0
"The best thing about this place was the decor. Food, service, everything else is so average. I was really expecting more. It wasn't horrible, but I won't be back.",0
"Ugh. Ate here because some coworkers said, \""You HAVE to try the bobo chicken!\"". More like doodoo chicken. What the f$!% did I just eat?!",0
Brian in the bar was awesome. Never forgot anything even though we know he was busy. Most of us work at yard house and we feel we got great service. We had a great time.,0
I can't believe this place is in business. The food is worse than you find in the freezer section at Walmart.,0
"The food and the service was horrible.  It was my first time, but was not impressed.  The service never came to ask how we were or to refill our drinks.",0
"Only came to AMC because we received a gift card. Their ticket prices suck, they do not honor my student discount and no Cherry Coke. Happy to throw money at Harkins hand over fist before I come back.",0
"Great hotel for cleanliness and convenience. It's not a destination hotel, of course, but we find it convenient to stay in to visit family and friends nearby. Within walking distance to some restaurants and shops.",0
Good Breakfast!  Not many Breakfast places in the Arboretum Area of CLT!,0
If you like roaches in your breakfast burritos... You have come to the right place!!! Won't be coming back here again!  Bleh!!!!,0
"Nice showroom for the HD experience. Some bikes were marked above retail HD price claiming market demand. I hate paying retail for anything. Don't expect any special discounts. Hey, it's where the celebrities buy and pay anything...",0
"Wow. This place was outstanding. Alluring, romantic environment, great service and outstanding food. Went with a big group for a business dinner, but looking forward to coming back with my wife for a date night.",0
Best Indian Buffet ever!!! My favorites were the naan of course and the tandori chicken.,0
"Bacon Night (with dollar beers) and Fish Bowls, nuff said. A must go to bar for downtown Madison on the weekends.",0
"Great food and service. The price may seem a bit high, but you get a ton of good food! Noise level was good-I could easily converse with my friends.",0
These guys moved my baby grand piano last week. They were incredible. They had a custom made piano dolly that made it look easy. They disassembled and reassembled the piano in no time. They were great.,0
I enjoy this Starbucks and believe me all of them are different. Love how they make chi tea lattes here but their service is just so so sometimes I prefer the drive through at this one.,0
People are great and the food is awesome. Been eating their pizza's regularly for a couple years now. Awesome!!,0
Very nice lunch spot. Fresh food and drinks and nice staff. I will return in the near future and strongly recommend.,0
"Found fries in my breakfast burrito, my sons burrito had huge chunks of oily bacon very disappointed. Got my money back never gonna eat there again! Rather go to Taco Bell.",0
"This place has EXCELLENT food, with generous helpings!\nMaybe that's why in the AM it usually has a bit of a line.\nI've never been disappointed, and the prices are very reasonable.",0
"This is my first \""Mexican\"" restaurant that I encountered in las vegas. The food is not so good. The margaritas are good. Simply said.",0
This was okay.  Not my favorite zoo or the best but still okay.,0
THis place has great wings and its a cool hole in the wall type feel.  You can tell this place has its regulars as the servers knew people by name.  I will definitely be back for more wings and cocktails!!,0
don't waste your time.  all my clothes came back with stains on them and they still charged me $84.00.  Bad service.,0
This place is absolutely gross the bathroom is horrible the rooms are dirty the wait time is insane over 4 hours when someone is in extreme pain is insane! Avoid this place if I could give it -100 stars I would,0
"Don't waste your time. The waitresses are beyond slow, and once they are done flirting with the table next to you, she might  visit your table and then disappear.",0
"Worst service of my life on my husband's birthday.This place truly sucks. I asked if they did anything for birthdays and said no not really. Which means \""I'm lazy and won't do anything\"" worthless place and worthless service",0
Free wifi saved my butt when mine at home froze up! And I was there late enough to get a free apple pie that someone ordered but never picked up!,0
Great service and great food. Got our food very fast and it was delicious. I will be back to have this place again.,0
Kind of a forgettable experience as far as Irish pubs go. I don't remember much about it. Bland at best...,0
We finally visited the Sunday brunch! Was presently surprised with the service and the drinks! Would highly recommend it and might just go right back!,0
Nothing too special.  Decent prices. PLace is also a hibachi place.,0
"Nice, clean local place in Green Tree. Might be a little pricey but the food is good and homemade.",0
PASS...\n\nVery mediocre food when surrounded by a lot of great options.  I can't believe the food network came here?!,0
Worst place ever! The help was using a dirty rag to clean around the trays and was touching the food with the dirty rag. Feel sick now. Gross!,0
we ordered 3 sandwiches and we asked for the dressing on the side and they said they could not do that. they were not allowed to have dixie cups so they had to put it in a cup.,0
I waited 30 min for two Oreo blasts. They weren't even made correctly so I left mine on the table. Wish I would have just got my money back. Never going back,0
"I had the Spaghetti alla Capri, it could of been better.\nmy husband had Pizza with sausage and mushroom he said it was good",0
I'm not a fan but I enjoy drinking at the bar area. So if you're coming to drink... not so bad. If you're coming to eat...  ah you might think again!,0
"Amazing customer service. Quick, friendly, great car selections and they give you the option to  choose which car you would like from their lot. Fast shuttle to take you to the airport. Can't believe how smooth and fast everything went.",0
A cozy spot just off the capital square with  a not to be missed breakfast selections all worth splurging over on your next visit,0
Average Chinese food. Seemed like small portions but it was actually more than enough.,0
"We ordered the vegetable samosas, onion kulcha and tandori combination. The spinach paneer was amazing. Everything was cooked well and seasoned well.  Going back very soon!",0
Outstanding food!\nHad the salad with shredded beef and was really tasty. No dressing needed here or even salsa for that matter. Service was great as well. Cute little place. Enjoyed myself and the atmosphere here.,0
"Bad fried rice. Cheap prices. Descent crab puffs, eggrolls, sesame chicken, and monk vegetables (could do without the almonds)",0
My previous review was for Carle Hospital. Not sure how it showed up here. Please fix.,0
"Only place in the valley that serves fresh and authentic Mexican food. The food is delicious, and they've even got fresh salsa! They have a wonderful, friendly staff. I won't go anywhere else for Mexican food.",0
Food is good. Cheese crisp is phenomenal! But prices are too expensive for a slightly higher than mediocre plate.,0
"This is a great place to get your dog's groomed if you can get them in, the wait for an appointment is ridiculous. It's almost worth the extra price to get them in sooner. :(",0
Downstairs bar is an absolute favorite.  Great small plates and even better service.  I love their stemware. :),0
My favorite Pho but I think it has a new name now?,0
"For dry cleaning they are extremely expensive. They are open everyday, however.",0
"You'd think Vegas would have a rockin airport, but this one is actually kind of shabby as airports go. But the option to 'buy' yourself a seat at a slot machine while you wait for a flight is unmatched.",0
Better than I had expected.  Pleasant staff and delicious food at reasonable prices.,0
Love this place! Good quality meats and Gnarly Service. Thanks!,0
"Atmosphere is casual, but food is GREAT! Plus...Fat Tire on tap! Read the rest of my reviews on Joe's for more details. Always a good experience!",0

love the too hot to eat shrimp etouffe favorite spicy dish in madison all the kinds of po boys ive tried have been very good could have better beverage selection i like the cornbread,0

"The waitress couldn't tell me which Shock Top they had on tap, and didn't know that a mudslide isn't always a frozen drink.\n\nAnd thanks place only takes cash.\n\nFuck this place.",0
"1. Great quality, size pizza, salad, wings for the price.\n2. Great pizza sauce and wing sauce.\n3. Pizza could use a lil more sauce, more ranch for salads.",0
I'm still waiting for my cab from last night.,0
Not bad! was very slow for a Saturday but the food came quick and prices were competetive with everyone else.,0
"What can I add that others haven't already said?  This place is adorable, the food is delicious, the wine selection is admirable and the employees are great.  \n\nGo.  Go now.",0
"The food is not good, and the service is really bad. They added the tips to the bill by themselves, which is very rude.",0
"Not my favorite at all, it was just ok. I would like to try the buffet though. I just did not think the flavors were all there.",0
Their lunch specials are always quick and delicious. Reasonable price for lunch and you can get your appetitie going with chips and salsa.,0
"I love this place! A quaint bakery nestled in a small plaza. Definitely a great find! There pastries are delicious, especially their sweet bread! The owner is a great guy!! The employees are nice!!",0
Great family oriented restaurant/bar where the staff is friendly and he food is good.  Kevin and his team always take good care of their customers.,0

Our favorite place in Tempe for Mexican. My wife goes for the Gollo burrito and I the Machaca both green style. It's fantastic and pretty cheap.,0
"Based on Yelpers' opinions, tried to order some take out. \nWe did not like the food. Period. They couldn't even make simple food. \nRating of zero is not available?",0
"Pretty good service, friendly staff, not all that comfortable and the sauce is very acidic and a weird texture to it.  Just not what I thought it would be, tried it a second time and decided it was not for me.",0
"They have a very limited menu, horrible service, and a really pushy staff. I'm sure there are better places out there for cheaper.",0
"Yeah, it's cheap. But my shirts come back crunchy. Could be better, could be worse.",0
"No! not a good Chinese bakery at all! The bread I had was dense, and oily! Definitely not like anything I would find in the bay area! Never again!",0
BBQ is good; great flavor in the rub for the meats.  I would not choose a non meat item.  My wife had the catfish and it was so so.  Service was really friendly and fast.,0

Food is ok for the price. Menu never changes though. Can get boring.,0
I bought a train set here for my son for Christmas.  He passed away due to cancer unable to use the train.  Roy's Train World would not take back the unopened train set.  Heartless.,0
It's by no means a Japanese restaurant. The only thing I think real is the instant miso soup. Don't ever order Sukiyaki Udon! I am so disappointed by it.,0
Their quesadilla burger gave me food poisoning. 'Nuff said.,0
The food I was served was nasty.  I will not go back there.,0
I always like this place. I don't think I have ever had a bad meal here.,0
"Very refreshing on a hot day. Personal fave is coconut/vanilla with some cream on top. Also, the drive thru is extra convenient for the lazy types.",0
My wife and I eat here a lot during lunch time.  The food is great and the service from the wait staff is excellent.  Their southwest salad and nachos are really good and I strongly recommend them.,0
Stay away from this company! 60+ wait while other companies actually knew how to quickly do the job. Use any other company! Rude employees also!,0
Great selection of beers and the bar tender Lisa was great. If you like local craft beers this is a great stop,0
"Excellent service, extremely polite employees, pricing very reasonable. Had the car checked out and tuned up before a cross country move and they got me on my way quickly. Definitely would recommend to friends and family",0
The food is absolutely average.  The service is not quite that good.  But it is one of those places that distributes buy one/get one style coupons.  If you have a coupon....what the heck.,0
"Sitting out by the pool today and it sucked. I had to ask for a server, and then the one we got couldn't answer a single question about the menu. The food was horrible and took 45 minutes. Not pleased at all.",0
Nondescript place serving great bean & cheese burritos and tacos.,0
While I love Harkins theaters this one hasn't been updated as much as others have.  It's a great theater to see art house films.  Staff here is awesome!,0
Had cod dinner and by far it was one of the worst fish dinners I have ever had. Very greasy fish and mushy fries. For $13.95 and 2 small pieces of Cod it was way over rated.,0
"Food does not taste good... has a plastic aftertaste, overpriced.",0
"Not only is the food overpriced and barely edible, the service is horrible! For the money, if you really need a chain restaurant, head down the road to Chilli's.",0
"Best homemade Italian food!  Fresh and homemade pasta.  Had \nthe fettuccine Alfredo w chicken and broccoli, best I ever had.  Bruschetta was awesome too.  Quick and friendly service.",0
Definitely miss State Street Brats. The place on game day or any day. Another reason why I got fat during college.,0
"Hands down my FAVORITE Mexican restaurant. The food is authentic, great and plenty. My favorite is the Campechana and their Parrilladas. The drinks are good to especially the mango margarita.",0
The place has reopened under a new owner.  They have cleaned it up quite a bit.  Prices are good and I will be checking it out again.,0
"Order your burger \""Carolina Style\"" and get the onion rings. Shakes ain't too shabby either.",0
Wow what a delicious and Fresh!! Place! I'm going back!,0
"Had work done to my Mitsubishi EclipseGT 07 for a duel exhaust system, with black tips. Pretty straight forward and simple with decent fair prices compared to other places.",0
Cleaner than any other QT I have ever been to. Very well stocked. Pleasant experience each time.,0
Absolutely nothing wrong with this mall. It's a mall as you know it :),0
Not worth $220 but the course is in wonderful shape.  The greens are amazing here.  The ball actually rolls where it should go.  +1 star!,0
"It's Six Flag's little sister!\n\n;D\n\nStill some fun,\ngets boring after a while.",0
"just a tad pricey i thought for Thai food, but the portions were more than enough to share with many....loved the soup, wish i remembered the name!",0
The food was ok.  But the service we had A LOT to be desired.  I don't plan on going back.,0
"All I'm sayin' is that I crave Thai Cuisine's Tom Kha Veggie soup. Perfect winter warm up, though I loved it in the summer just the same.",0
This is a really nice fry's. Their bakery is actually better than most of their other locations.,0
Lentil soup had barely any lentils n had a grilled cheese sandwich with one maybe 2 slices cheese. Won't bother coming back,0
Food was ok. I didn't care about the ambience.,0
Did I just pee outside?  I think I just peed into a cascading waterfall deep in the wilderness. This place rocks.,0
Delicious prickly pear and boysenberry although a little too sweet.  Live music.  Comfortable.,0
"Great quality, good portions, excellent value!  One of my favorite places in Madison for Pho noodles and Vietnamese spring rolls.",0
This is a good place to meet up for drinks and some appetizers. Small cozy place with a european feel.,0
"Place was not clean- tables were dirty, bathrooms were horrible. Too close for comfort at the lanes when bowling next to another family.",0
A little overpriced but the bagels are always good and fresh. The cinnamon French toast (made from their cinnamon log bread) is also very good!,0
"Great concept though poorly executed, service was slow and borderline indifferent, fries served were old and when asked for fresh the response was not so service like.\nOK for a quick visit though next time I'll go to Red Robin.",0
"Large portions, enough food for multiple meals. Ordered the Hawaiian Plate with kalua pork. Yum. Awesome prices! Friendly service. \n\nWould definitely visit again if in town.",0
One of my least favorite airports in the country. Stay away from those slots!,0
"This may be the worst McDonalds in Arizona.  Poorly designed facility makes it almost impossible to access soft drinks and condiments.  To top it off, the food is usually stale or cold.",0
"Their bagels are great, but the place is packed on weekend mornings. Service is still quick even when it is busy though.",0
Just a plain ol' pawn shop with overpriced items due to the success of the show...I've seen wayyy better pawn shops than this one... but had to check it out anyway...lol,0
"I love this Home Depot! Everyone is very friendly! \""Art\"" pointed us in the direction of a $5 solution for what was looking like a $1,000 problem. Very helpful, well-stocked and close to my home.",0
A great place to stay if your in town for a game. Within walking distance of everything. The rooms aren't that bad either.,0
"if your in the casino and don't want to leave this is the place for you. other then that, there are better places.",0
The portions were small and the prices were high.  I really didn't see a distiction between this type of food and any number of small indian places.,0
Shrimp po boy was delicious. Quickly prepared and exceeded expectations. Would definitely recommend.,0
Not as good as I expected. The food was ok but not crazily yummy like shown on triple Ds,0
"The food is decent, the service is better than your average Madison restaurant and the bathrooms were clean.  It is a bit out of our way but it is consistent enough to warrant more visits.",0
"I sometimes pick up bagels for the folks at work, usually on Fridays. This Einstein's location is always fast, efficient and clean. The staff are very friendly and take the time to go the extra mile.",0
Had lunch.  Everything was good.  Great service.,0
See my tip! Subway just sucks. They are cheap and want to charge for extra ingredients! How about putting on a fair amount of ingredients in the first place!,0
The place was decent and so was the food.  I especially liked the potato salad as a side dish.,0
"I love this place beyond words.  They have a good selection of vegan food, and their fake meat is awesome.The soynamis and oatmeal cookies are amazing.  Can't recommend it enough.",0
I have been coming here and all of their locations for 15 years. It is always an excellent experience and the food is excellent and very consistent even at different locations around the country. Great food at a fair price. Good friendly staff.,0
It had no taste. Ordered many different things and was left unsatisfied.,0
"Usually have a little wait even with an appointment, but it gives the kiddo time to play with the train and pick her movie.",0
Bartender is the rudest p.o.s.,0
"I love Dr. Porter and his staff. They make you feel like family. Very thorough and explains everything to you. They truly care about you, it's not just a job.",0
Was not all the impressed by their dishes.  The one dish that stood out was the fried oysters. The XO string bean and fried rice were mediocre. Their seafood looked very good unfortunately they had run out of rock fish cod.,0
"Ok Mexican food.  Stopped in for lunch and ordered the number three which is a two taco and cheese enchilada plate. Food was ok, but nothing I would go back for.",0
"Eeh. Its okay if you feel like taking a day off from the kitchen. Had their dessert once, I wasn't blown away but im not really big on sweets. Service isnt the greatest either.",0
"Perfect atmosphere. Best BLT, fried pickles and pasta salad(with Stevie's dressing.) One of my favorites in Charlotte.",0
"The place is huge with lots of stores to see,  but there plus size selection is very disappointing!",0
They have changed owners and we do not go there. They do not go out of their way to help you in a crunch. No need for them with so many other places to choose from.,0
"They picked up my documents, and got them to the mortgage company before the promised delivery time. I would use them again. Website is easy to use as well.",0
"Broth was really, really good..... the veggies in my vegan pho however was obviously old which was disappointing but my friends beef pho was perfect (so she says)",0
"Place is horrible period.....,,went for all you can eat sushi quality is poor and on top of that a ton of rice!",0
Three words--chilli cheese fries.  YUM!,0
"Ironworks is a great spot after a nice 18 holes.  Exactly what you would expect, but a gem in the middle of the North Valley.",0
Worst airport I've ever been to. It's old. There's no signage. You have to walk 15 minutes off a highway with no direction to get to Terminal 2.\n\nThis airport is a dump.,0
Fantastic food!  Cool atmosphere. Seems to be pretty popular. Small place. Great selection. Sauces are fantastic!  Might be some of the best food I have ever had!  Would go here again in a heartbeat!,0
"Delicious food, great service, good music and environment, friendly staff and very reasonable prices! And the best mojitos in town!!",0
The orange chicken lunch rice bowl was very delicious and so were the egg rolls. I will defiantly be coming back.,0
My favorite mexican food restaurant. Best salsa! Tortilla soup is so so good. Mini beef tacos with cheese!,0
Another bad experience.  The staff is sloppy.  The deli doesn't mark the product and passes off whatever slimey old crap they're trying to get rid of as what you ordered.  And good luck parking.,0
"Many good galleries and studios are located in the Arts Factory. Now also the Bar + Bistro with activities happening every week.\nHighly recommend for art, food and cocktails.",0
"Decent pizza, but not great.  Garlic cheese bread was mediocre.  Apple pastry dessert was pretty damn good.  I give the experience 3.5 stars.",0
"carne asada taco is the item to get here! make sure to order it \""con todo\"" with everything. taco de pollo is a close second.",0
This place really scares me sometimes.  I bit into a taco last night and grease literally streamed out the other end.  Luckily I'm already on Lipitor.,0
"The service is wonderful, friendly people, and the service is wonderful. This place deserves a six star rating. A must try!",0
I ordered delivery a few months ago. Their sandwich and fries were good but the pizza was COMPLETELY BURNT TO THE PINT WHERE IT WAS INEDIBLE.,0
= = = = = = CLOSED = = = = = =\n\nThis place has closed & a similar restaurant is now here in it's place.,0
"The brew is ok I have had better, and the pizza is ok, nothing crazy good and the atmosphere is alright, I'd rather go somewhere else any day.",0
company dose not care about getting rid of flies in restaurant.  It is awful. Service is not good.,0
"This place is horrible. regulars are rude, bikers wear colors and tension is high. new owners did nothing to improve it, but  raised the prices.",0
"I've been here several times.I have no big complaints against this store, as they've always gotten my order correct.",0
Some of the best Cuban food I've had and very reasonably priced as well! \n\nI can never decide between the bistecs cubano or the bacaloa (salt cod)!,0
We had a fun relaxing time my friend had the caesar salad it was fantastic my bf had  ham X it was good and I had the sweet n spice asian salad it was out of this world and our waitress was awesome,0
"Food was ok, nothing that stood out, crowded and slow service, most likely wont be back, nothing to drive across town for!",0
I think the low marks for this place are unwarranted. Quality of food at this location is every bit as good as the other Atria's around town. Pot roast nachos are out of this world!,0
"I stayed here last night. I did not appreciate not having a coffee machine in the room, and the forced-on valet parking.",0
"Nice atmosphere, way strong drinks, interesting music selection. I had a great time at Le Mardi Gras, and I left drunk and happy.\n\nMerci Beaucoup, mes amies!",0
"This place is tasty!!! Chicken Katsu is the best with the spinach salad!  They have one of the best desserts, Grandma's chocolate cake and you have to get it with the coconut ice cream!!! Yummmmm!!!!",0
The standard breakfast is fine.  The unusual items are just unusual.,0
I went with my family to breakfast at this diner. I ordered a veggie omelette it was very good. Basic diner. Nice atmosphere. Love the fact they had flavored creamer for my coffee. Coffee was so so.,0
Delivery was delivered on time when requested. Delivery man was friendly. Food on the other hand was far from statisfying. Have had better food in the past. Disappointed this time,0
Best menudo in town. Great salsa. I've only eaten the menudo because it's so good that I haven't wanted to order anything else.,0
Great lunch spot near the office.  Decent beer selection and tasty food choices.,0
"The service was great, I love my server!",0
"Was a great place to eat, now food is greasy, and it doesn't taste like it used to. Used to have a more of a homemade taste, now tastes like Costco business center. Sad. I loved going here.",0
"Great upscale selection. Desserts, pasta, fish etc. great coffee.",0
The worst place to ever order on the phone! They don't make it until you get there. What's the point of ordering in advance?,0
Judy Moore and her team offer beautiful and affordable jewelry. They are experts in the jewelry world and can guide you to the perfect gift for a loved one or yourself. I highly recommend them!,0
Save yoursel time and go to the pet haircut place next door and ask them to box you up a dog treat.,0
"Very nice and attentive staff. Typical bar food. Dive bar atmosphere. Good happy hour prices. Locals hang out. Small. 1 pool table. Nothing impressive, but I'd go back sometime.",0
"Yo, their store is awesome!  That dude, Richard, is da bomb! He hooked it up hardcore, mos def!",0
"Seriously awesome pizza, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The salads are HUGE! Oh, and don't forget a pizookie!!",0
"I drive from DC Ranch area to see the staff at Artistic Dental. They are super friendly, professional, punctual, and don't push extra products on me. I've referred numerous new-Arizonians to this place.",0
Steak and eggs!! The homemade green salsa is really good.,0
"Good home cooked food. Family ran, great seafood dishes and ok salsa bar (lunch only). Love the big shrimp tacos. Lunch time is good with a self serve salsa bar.",0
This place is good depending on what you get. Kind of hit and miss. I had a Carne aside burrito I didn't like. The lunch special is a good deal. The beans are really good. Fried fish is really good.,0
"Hey, its nice.  Good food, good drinks, very cosy...and again, NO SMOKING...a perfect place.  Great for after work gatherings...",0
Soooooo good! Love this place for fast and cheap but yummy Mexican food. My favorite is the carne asada tacos but my boyfriend never gets anything but the pollo fundido.,0
Sorry but food was not worth it chicken burrito reminded\n me of why I disliked chicken in the past.,0
Tried this Burger King again. I sat in line at the drive thru for 45 minutes while the three employees just stood around. I left without getting anything. I watched 4 other customers just give up and leave before I did.,0
Service was slow people here seemed very confused on what was going on they have boxes laying around the store it's 3 stars at best,0
Excellent food. Poor service tonight as it's during Barrett Jackson auto show and place is slammed.,0
"This place was awful, I was there for rehab  the therpists were ok,there were some awesome Cna's  the food service was really bad no selection and tasted like shit. I wouldnot recommend this place to anyone!",0
Manager there has no people skills very rude and unprofessional. Will never shop there again.,0
"Better than most, not as good as the best. Just an avegage wash. Good news, I will be back though. Good enough for that",0
My new favorite restaurant in AZ. This is the kind of place I have been looking for since I moved here. Real authentic Italian food finally!,0
Very nice clean Subway. Staff was friendly but a little slow and my wife actually made a comment on how skimpy they were with the veggies (this from a 110 lb waif). You could do worse than this Subway. Recommend.,0
wife drags me here I could do with out for sure,0
Food was great but the service was subpar and it wasn't too busy.  This is a great locals spot without a long wait which is why we love it.\nThe bread basket is by far the highlight!,0
"Didn't try the food but they had a very impressive wine list, really cool atmosphere, and very friendly and knowledgeable bar staff.",0
"Driving down Central the other day I got the munchies mid morning.  I got a croissant sandwich.  The palce was clean, the service was pleasant, and my sandwich was cooked fresh.",0
"Not like your local foods. If your a foodie, you can spend hours in here. There is a huge prepared foods area, a bar/tasting area, coffee area, smoothie bar, huge olive bar and chocolate bar.",0
"Close to home, in a shopping center where not much is affordable. The ice cream is pricey but tasty and the place has a good vibe to it. Peanut butter cup perfection creation is fabulous. Nice kids working there.",0
Red burro enchilada style with rice and a Diet Coke. Eat it out on the patio with the stray dogs. I love it.,0
Best friggin wings ever. Ask for them GRILLED after frying!,0
"Bleh.\n\nCombine a dated interior, too few charging stations, expensive drinks, and a funky smell in the air and you have the recipe for McCarran.\n\nNot a fan.",0
"We have been going to Majerle's for years. The atmosphere, the food and the service are always good. The prices have always been reasonable.",0
Great dive bar and great bartenders. Jester room is a must.,0
Many Gluten free options.\nFood is fresh and healthy \nLove the chicken pho and beef or pork bun. \nSpring tools are delicious too!,0
"I needed my Whirlpool oven repaired, so I called E&J Appliance.  They gave me a 2 hour window, and showed up right at the start.  The repair was quick and painless.  Great service!",0
Great Pizza Every time!! Had some with the fam tonight.,0
I did go back and had the enchiladas plate which was what you'd expect but yummy and filling.\n\nGood if you got the craving for mexican food. Easy on the wallet too.,0
"We had dinner in this restaurant. Everything was awesome! Customer service, food, life music and good Italian vine.I suggest you reserve table before coming. Very nice place!",0
"The burgers and steak fries very good, and the crispy chicken burger is also very good non beef choice. The Towering onion rings are shareable and worth a try.",0
This is such a great downtown business!  The owners make you feel welcome and remember your name and your preferences.  They even get peanut butter yogurt samples ready when they see our dog walking up - now that is great service!,0
"I love the pollo fundido and baraccho burrito. Super no frills, yummy Mexican food. Decent prices. Clean and quick, lots of choices. Go for 5 dollar fundido Wednesdays!",0
A boba place?  In the desert?  Oh yes!\n\nI actually still crave the watermelon smoothie with boba.  Most refreshing drink ever created.,0
"Slices is good for a East Coast pizza fix. Nice thin slices, heated to crunchy after you select from a bank of pre-made pizzas. Cheap, quick eats for lunch!",0
Was like any other typical bbq place. Unsure why there was so much hype. Service was slow. Food was tepid.,0
"Left them a message to make an appointment--no return call. Went to the Tempe office instead, which was awesome!",0
"the waiting is soo freaking long...but on the upside, what do you expect for a lot of cheap great food?",0
"Oh my goodness, the salmon-wich is fabulous!  Awesome smoked salmon with amazing avocado dressing and scrumptious bread.   Amazing!!",0
"Get the pastrami, swiss, and egg on pumpernickel. It is amazing and service is quick. Being from out of town this is so much better than Starbucks.",0
"Comfortable and flavorful, and I hear there's a nice view when it's not so cloudy...that actually might have bumped the rating up a star.",0
Really awesome and delicious food. Korean chicken bowl!! And under 4.00,0
"The farmer salad, the bread, and then the pizza. Who says you can't get great pizza outside of NY. Great meal. Worth a drive.",0
Love this place service is great they make you feel very welcome like part of the family it's very clean food is top notch don't pass this one up,0
WIth an area that is lacking a nice place to go for lunch this place really hits the spot.  Service is great and food is excellent.,0
"Good service!! Food was okay, I got the carne asada taco plate but the salsa but the chips and salsa were bomb.com",0
Some of the best fish and chips i have ever had. I would definitely recommend sitting in the patio.,0
For some reason this location isn't as good as the rest. The dining is always dirty and the patio looks like crap.,0
"The gym will be closed in June 2011.  Their reason --  \""Lease is up\""",0
"Meh. The bread was cold, the bean dip it's served with was cold, the mushroom dish that was described as served over risotto was served over cold orzo. Didn't knock my socks off.",0
I have always had an excellent meal here.  I was surprised the one in Phoenix closed down.,0
Food sucked. But atmosphere was great with the many people we were with.,0
"Typical sports bar, other then being owned by Dan Majerle. Nice location, right on the metro rail.  Bit on the pricy side.",0
I have been here for eyebrow waxing. My eyebrows were halfdone. I had to come home and pluck the leftout hair..,0
Definately don't treat their employees well. Two thumbs down!,0
Great place to watch a game or just grab a good bite to eat. The prices are reasonable and the amount of food you get for the price is pretty good. I would suggest the wings and the cheese fries...the fries were rather awesome.,0
"Besides the seared foie gras & breathtaking view, the food was mediocre the last few visit.",0
"Large airport, easy to navigate, and quick security lines.  Taxi lines are long but quick and well organized.\n\nIt's a bit dirty for my style, but what else can you expect from an airport?",0
"We had their cheese pizza and wings, it was pretty good. The best thing about the pizza was the crust. The wings were nothing special.",0
"The sign says: \""Closed 5/14 - 10/25\""",0
"The airport itself is decent. I would never gamble here, but i do see people at the slots. the monorail is fun to ride to  baggage claim.\n\nbeware spirit airlines!",0
Posted hours: 10:45am. Doors are locked at 11:15 and no one picks up the phone. Hopefully this means they are out of business because this place has gone so far down hill,0
"I had to come here about 8 pm on a weeknight last week:\n- To pick up solder, 1/2 inch threadless water valve and flux.\n- First employee approached said he'll call for a plumb",0
"The car was nice, the service was terrible. Can I give zero stars?",0
Labs usually require a long wait unless you make an appointment in advance which I never remember to do.,0
Very nice facilities. Lots of room by the lanes. Good for groups.  The staff is  friendly and informative. Great retail as well. Ladies day on Fridays..(free shooting and gun rental),0

Food was okay. Had the Aloha Bento.  The beef was tough.  Chicken and fish were good.,0
"I must start my review by stating that I stayed on the strip, but visited the Golden Nugget during my stay and was pleasantly surprised. This place is beautiful!!! My heart skipped with joy and delight over this Legendary landmark.",0
"Food is good, speed is good when there are few people in the restaurant and drive-thru, staff is moderately friendly. Most of the tables looked clean.",0
"Great video store...huge selection of indy and foreign films, as well as mainstream.  Employees give ratings on some of the movies.  Only downside, some of the people behind the counter have huge attitudes.",0
Good Food but terrible service.\n\nWaiters are always very rude and short.\nthey need an attitude adjustment!!\n\nwould get five stars if they had better service,0
"Super friendly staff.\n\nBasic, decent food.\n\nRun down, western, rustic decor.",0
For AZ this is as good as Korean food gets!!  Go if you need your Korean fix and have some Japanese rolls or food if you are craving both.,0
Always a good time. Bar area is small and crowded but worth it to see all the cool acts that come through this venue.,0
"Spent north of $1200 for simple food in one of their boxes last week. After charging me a %20 \""service fee\"" on the food, they ask for a %15 tip as well. Going to the ball park next time.",0
This is the kind of independent country place we all need to get behind and support if we don't want the entire landscape consisting of the big chain restaurants.,0
I love this Pizza place!!!!!I had the white pizza and it is amazing!!!The only set back is its kinda pricey compared to other pizza joints but it is worth it for the quality of the pizza!!!,0

Brian and his team are extremely friendly. They attend to your concerns and solve them. I love renting cars from this location. Any day!,0
"The food was great but the service is some of the worst I've ever experienced. The manager, Samantha, really needs a lesson in customer service. Completely rude!",0
our local newspaper. Lots of good stuff but the same as online. lvrj.com\nGet the paper a lot cheaper at McDonald's,0
Went here for a graduation dinner. The food is grossly overpriced and the decor reminded me of a converted doctor's office or 90's sitcom. Not what you'd expect on mount Washington.,0
"A great little place for lunch in Kierland. Even when I walk past it, it's classic decor and bar stools make me smile.",0
"Tasty dishes - I had panfried noodles/shrimp, had vegetables; my husband had orange shrimp, had broccoli, not too spicy. But service was indifferent and menu didn't explain what was in each dish.",0

Wide variety and a very friendly staff!!! Also open 24-7 always a plus...,0
Didn't understand I wanted the lunch special and not the lunch plate. Mostly vegetables in the Kungpow chicken. Place is run down. Large portions.,0
Pretty basic room with a flat screen TV. Beds were not comfortable but the room was clean and not bad. Only one elevator and you have to go through the main lobby. Would try to find a better place before staying here again.,0
Great supermarket...has most foods that you need from around the world at really good prices,0
Great course for the price. Employees are friendly. The greens were in good shape as well as the fairways. Something goofy going on in the rough but it was heading into off season so no big deal.,0
This place is amazing. I adore the Chicken Katsu but everything on the menu is good! The owner is lovely and they work really hard and do a great job!,0
We had our car windows tinted there this morning.  LOVE IT!  They were done ahead of schedule and did a great job.,0

"Excellent service, delicious food in a family environment! Whats there not to love? We left with a smile on our face and lots of pizza :)",0
"Nice red velvet cupcake with cream cheese icing, but all the cupcakes had too much icing - sugar and fat overdose!! The guava and cheese pastry wasn't great.",0
"went back there today and asked for two simple burgers with nothing but ketchup and cheese, not hard, right? apparently it is if your english is as good as your order taking skills",0
It's horrible pizza. Order four large pizzas and out of the four times I have gone the pizza is extremely greasy. If you like greasy pizza then go for it but its horrible.,0
"Yeah, it's a Starbucks, but the staff are great.  Always ready with a pre-dawn smile.",0
"Not sure who the other reviewer worked with, but I've never had a bad experience with Rubin's.  Some pieces are lackluster, but the store is generally reliable.  Alternative comp is Century House.",0
Stopped in for fun. I'm not familiar with pawn shops but I was expecting items to be priced under retail. These items are used right? TVs and other electronics were the same price as brand new. \nI'll pass...,0
This place is horrible the food is so over Americanized it didn't even have flavor was Super Dissapointed! I live near by and I will never go back!,0
The best jiffy lube I ever went to. All 3 staffs took a time and check everything they can. They were so fast and professional. I felt bad that they were all sweating for my old car. Thank you.,0
I have been a patient of MVFP for over 10 years.  I have a great Dr. (Roseann Collins). And I find them to be organized and efficient.  Nothing but good experience with them.\nRichard,0
"Thin crust, good sauce, fast service, and clean. If you like New York style pizza and you're in the area this isn't a bad option.",0
"The best Italian in Charlotte.  Period.  I have been going there on Sunday night for 20 years.  The food, the people and the ambience cannot be replaced by any other restaurant I have ever frequented.",0
"It's Starbucks, what else do you need to know.",0
Delicious! Very homely with simple dishes. Relatively priced with a good aroma. 5 stars easy.,0
"Another east-side dive bar... not great, but not bad either.",0
The Beef on Weck was awesome. The Portabella Mushroom Parmesan was good too. Gotta go back to try other food on the menu.,0
This use to be a course I played often. The condition of the course and overall rude treatment led me to vow to never play there again! Which I have stuck with!,0
"Great tortillas and tamales served with sticky floors, scary bathrooms and regularly overflowing waste cans hurts Carolina's reputation. If they could hose the place down once in awhile, it would definately get more stars from me.",0
"Great food, huge portions, waiter knowledgeable about ingredients. We'll enjoy this just as much as the takeaway as we did in the restaurant!",0
Great service and great food.  Love the combo plate.,0
"I do photo shoots with brides all over Las Vegas, but the Neon Museum is still my all time favorite place to shoot. Epic!",0
Terrible sound. Terrible lighting. Screens cut out half way through the encore but that really didn't bother me bc it was bad quality anyway.\nGood job on making a Yeah Yeah Yeahs show suck.,0
This is one of the filthiest restaurants I have ever had the misfortune to go into - I was shocked that this place remains open.  The food was worse than mediocre - truly poor in every aspect.\nICK.,0
Great bunch of people...I've gone there for years.  Just got a call from CVS they are taking over their prescriptions!  What??  What happened to them?  Why did they close?  I'm NOT happy!!,0
"The store was very clean and well stocked. The womens restroom smelled nice as I walled by, but the mens room was nasty.",0
"I'd like to thank Groupon for refunding my money back.  Never was a customer of this place because I simply \""never had time\"" as the response was so kindly put.",0
Worst customer service! But they don't care! I even spoke to a manager and he would not exchange my defective device.  What happen to taking care of your customer?,0
-Fancy salad place.\n\n-Salads are very yummy.\n\n-Parking is a pain in the butt.\n\n-Pricey for lunch.,0
"The art, architecture, and views are all spectacular. A highlight of our LV trip. Highly recommend the Villa as well.",0
This place is HUGE!  You have to shuttle to your Gate. Security lines are long. SECURITY is intense here!  Body scanners?!  WOW!\nIt's an awesome airport though!,0
Its ok.... Its ASU and kids dont really know where the good sushi is. Well its not in AZ lol. \n\nIts descent prices are way too high,0
"Another day another Italian sub. Firehouse makes them very, very well and always tasty. Just the thing to hit the spot on a long shift.",0
"Lady at the front, I'm assuming owner is extremely rude! I was having trouble understanding paperwork necessary and there were no customers and she was not willing to help. Shockingly horrible service!",0
Really like the food here. A little expensive but a nice treat.,0
"Worst dining experience anywhere ever. Have to correct our order twice. Food is really salty. Don't bother going there, please!",0
"Happy hour was pretty decent, service was on point...best part? Seared tuna salad! Definitely good enough to keep going back :)",0
This place is okay just a hole in the wall to me that uses a microwave to reheat about everything. There horchata is good but everything else is cold...,0
"If you need a hat, this is where to go.",0
I've been coming to this nail salon for awhile now and it never disappoints! The staff is friendly and helpful and I have never left upset with my experience. I love it!,0
I agree with previous review. Butter fish was awful.  Onion rings tasted like cardboard.  Thank goodness it was happy hour prices otherwise we would have let the mgr know how awful the food was.  We will never return!,0
"great happy hour prices, kid friendly, the food is decent for the pricing.",0
Nice Facility. But most of the staff is very rude. Especially the lady in the reception and batting cage.,0
Food was crap. Everything tasted the same. Like they have one universal sauce. Service was decent. Won ton soup suckd. Broth with one won ton. No vegetables. Wont eat here again,0
"Following a tire rotation on 12/26, I found two of the wheel lug nuts only hand tight.  One fell out in a parking lot and was luckily found.  Not impressed.",0
"I used to love going here, but recently every time i call the phone has been disconnected.",0
I don't really like But  review just I don't recommend  no one -go there because I swear I will never ever go back there even it is for free,0
"I'm spoiled by the outlet mall in Vegas cuz this one sucks. No Sketchers killed it for me, but I didn't see a ton of other shops I wanted to visit when I went looking for shoes. Bummer.",0
Affordable and good.  Clean restaurant.  Will return.,0
"I can't remember the name of the bar, there's a huge aquarium behind the bar.  There Margarita's are amazing!  If you love Margaritas, you need to check there's out.",0
The food and service were really good; even on a Saturday night there were no long waits to be seated.  In Scottsdale that's a privilege. We'd definitely go back again.,0
Found on yelp. What a great old fashioned ice cream parlor! Service was excellent and the sundaes were amazing!,0
"Large portions, nice people. I recommend the streak and chicken with-rice more than the pasta. Love the all you can eat bread with fresh herbs.",0
"Ever since i found a pair of Stuart Weitzman shoes here for $50, I go about twice a year, just to check it out.",0
"Fast, affordable, excellent service!  \nWent in today at lunch to have my iPhone 4 screen repaired and couldn't be happier with my experience.  \nVery kind and friendly staff.",0
Meh.  \nThat's about as much enthusiasm as I can muster for this place...,0
"You can ask to try samples! Watch out for the nuclear cherries, they're soaked in everclear!",0
"The store is very clean, and the staff is friendly. But this is the slowest moving Starbucks I have ever been to. Elect to wait around for at least 10 minutes with little to no line.",0
Very friendly staff. Nice selection and food was good. Great for a casual lunch or dinner!,0
"I've tried this place a few times, that was my last time. The food is not good to me.",0
Food is pretty good. Solid cheap Chinese take out.,0
Course was okay (not great) and the drink cart only came by once.,0
Decent.  Room had a musky smoker smell to it. Nothing to write home about.,0
"Love the food, staff and ambiance of the place.  I have been eating there for 4 years and just love it.  My favorite dish is the 2 fish tacos with black beans.  They also have great wines at good prices.",0
Quite nice.  The private water park is a blast for kids and keeps kids away from the other pools which is a blast for adults.,0
I took pictures while at this location last week. Its a ok store didn't care for the staff attitudes tho so I give it 2stars.,0
Got the half lb. ranch burger. It was good. Don't. See what the big hype is over,0
Stopped by for dessert based on reviews.  Cute little place.   We ordered a small hot fudge sundae and a small pineapple sundae.  Both were very good and service was very quick.,0
"This place is very cool as it sells a lot of everyday needs for cheaper cost.  They have a lot of different locations through out the state, definitely a good place to shop if you don't want to break your bank.",0
"I had a Penthouse Presidential Suite! I will never forget this trip. It was THE best stay i have ever had with luxurious accomadations. Thank you Golden Nugget, i will be back!",0
"Feels a slight bit pricey, but overall tasty food and very friendly service. That about sums it up I think. Not remarkable, but definitely good enough.",0
"This store has been bought out by the people who own Bombay restaurant, and is primarily an Indian grocery now. I really miss Euro Mart.",0
pretty good breakfast spot but $6 for a small glass of orange juice is a bit much. the Denver omelette was solid.,0
I literally ate two ribs and decided they were too much like a pressed mcrib to trust them. The cornbread tasted faintly of fish. Fries were decent. Couldn't get a refill on my soda. I won't be back.,0
i came for a weekend to celebrate a bachlerotte and decided to come in and get my nails done. i absoulutley love them....this will be my to go place every time i go to vegas now....,0
"I'm drunk, I come here and order a hot and spicy (sub The mannaise  with Mac sauce) and 2 breakfast burritos. Tell me why I didn't get any hot and spicy??? What the fudge???",0
"Very long wait (even though we arrived early and there were few waiting), extremely slow service, food was tasty though.",0
I would much rather buy a store brand hot dog and Hormel chili and make my own. Dip cone was the best thing. Service sucked rude not friendly.,0
Terrible bar. If you're not a regular you get ignored. The staff is not attentive at all and when asked to order a drink looked annoyed. Don't come here unless you love bad service.,0
"THE best cheesesteaks, freshest buns, there is nothing bad here!!",0
"it isn't the most wonderful place. services was okay. down part is, they dont Accept Discover nor Amex? seriously who does that?????\n\nwont be returning there. thanks tho.",0
Burgers way over cooked and overpriced. Fries were ok. Maybe expectations were a bit high. Menu is limited. Probably a great place to drink beer though.,0
"Very cheap, room was clean. Free parking with rewards card. Staff was friendly. The only negative thing is the noise level. Can't sleep at night with the bands playing.",0
"Great Hatch spicy Beans, Queso Fundido is hot and spicy love the spinach enchiladas. It's pretty good food.",0
"Great food, never had a bad meal there.  I love that they get their desserts from Signature Desserts.",0
The only good thing about this place is the reasonable monthly membership!! Other than that the customer service is a joke and the gym is dirty!! Do not recommend if u can afford to go somewhere else! :(,0
Great place to go for great beer and amazing food. It is really hard to have a group larger then 6 to get a table together sense they really don't allow reservations.,0
"A nice place to have a sandwich and enjoy the open space!. Good to brunch in a big group. I still haven't try the morning glory cafe, but soups and sandwiches feel FRESH!",0
"Well, I'll never go to Vegas again, but that's not because of the airport.\nGot through security pretty quick, that was nice.  Wish there was more selection of food, rather than sacrificing that space for slot machines.",0
"Ok for the family, but I would not go out of my way to come back.",0
Not too busy mid-day. Lots of indoor and outdoor seating.,0
"Has everything you could need, helpful staff, big parking lot.",0
Hated it! There was a red ink like thing on my burger. Garbage cans were full. Never again.  Yuck!!!,0
"Great lil place for breakfast! Husband and I both had eggs over medium, one sausage, one bacon, hash browns and sourdough toast. Everything was cooked perfect. Very good, fast service!",0
Extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  They were professional and timely.  I would use them again.,0
"LOVE THIS PLACE! It's really fun and laid back, and is excellent for live music. If you can catch the Think Horses or the Sugar Thieves playing, all the better!",0
It's IHOP. I'm still alive. \n\nFood is good. Large selection of food from breakfast (Crazy huge omelets!) to dinner. Sometimes hard to make a quick decision.,0
"I've yet to play the course but I spend many Sundays on the driving range.  Beautiful view of downtown Phoenix.  Old school feel, lots of fun.",0
"The most amazing fish. I take all my colleagues in from out of town. Moriscos is an amazing \""hole in the wall\"" secret. The fish smothered with plablano pepper is my favorite. An absolute winner.",0
Best place in town Susan is the best bartender ever. Great food. Tanner is the best server ever. If you want friendly service come to this place!!!,0
"Best philly cheese steak I have come across in Charlotte. If you want an easy, delicious sub, this is the place to go.",0
"Good diner-type food. Friendly service. Really good milkshakes. Nice family atmosphere. Cute decor. \n\nI would definitely recommend this, especially as a casual dinner spot for families.",0
Awesome place if you like your hair looking like you are 8 years old. Disappointing.,0
Extremely slow... We waited entirely too long for food.,0
This place is great.  Simple menu and the food is excellent if you're looking for a good burger and fry.,0
This bar is cool and hip. Funky and fresh to see something different. The have games and a quaint atmosphere. Huge drinks and cool people. A must see.,0
"Wonderful food, great service and the best hospitality in town. We found this restaurant through Yelp and it turned out to be a gem. Great family owned business with wonderful homemade recipes. Would recommend!!!",0
This place smells like a urinal and bums and druggies hanging out in front. Will never go here and I advise you don't either.,0
"Ok, maybe this isn't the best pizza. The one pie I had tried was the sausage mushroom melt, which was always delish! I tried another combination last time I ordered and it was cardboard-y and not so good. Meh.",0
Its not bad. If you feel the need to gamble. Waitress' are fast if your tipping.But all in all not bad. The bartenders are a little slow.,0
Be sure to get their Indian Curry. You won't be disappointed.,0
May be good - but must have more business than he can handle.\nCalled and left a message that the heater in my Phoenix house had quit.  Left phone number.  No response.,0
Never. Over priced salt lick with an autistic staff.,0
"My go to place for quick chinese food. The food is good, especially for quick service. The service is quick and the people are nice. Exactly what you can expect from a quick service chinese restaurant",0
The worst home warranty insurance I have ever seen. They are rude and unprofessional. They are so scared that they don't even let you talk to the owner if you have a complain.,0
My friend picked up food here for us and her chicken was hardly cooked! Another friend had the same problem! I think this sums it up!,0
Best vets office ever!  These folks love pets more than any other vets I have ever been to. Fancy place in a very convenient location. Highly recommend.,0
"The place has an awful smell, the condiments table is super dirty, and my Chicago beef was lackluster",0
"What can I say, you get what you pay for... its ansuper 8 so my expectations weren't high but the rooms were visually clean and staff seemed friendly... very small room with king size bed and older tv",0
"I highly recommend Dr. Tammy Reynolds. She's personable, professional, and extremely caring.  You will be in good hands.  I really appreciate her.",0
Amazing stuff! I do wish that the staff was a bit friendlier though if not I would've given it 5 stars,0
"I ordered my glasses, they called me when they arrived, and I went to pick them up.\nThe staff was friendly and answered all my questions.",0
"Great food, but on a Sunday afternoon it was extraordinarily slow. We waited almost 2 hours for our food. There was one person working the front and one person cooking.",0
"My husband had been buying me jewelry here for a few years.  They went back on their word about a return.  We were there to exchange and buy more, now they have lost our business for good.",0
They were very helpful in finding the leak that I had and was very professional.,0
LOYAL local's lunch spot. Great service. Average food. Complimentary soup.,0
"Love the matcha green tea with boba and the sweet buttered toast is good too.  But It's a little over priced, and they could use some new staff cause the women waitresses were just rude and unhelpful.",0
"$8 for a tiny sandwich with one egg, two greasy strips of bacon, and a stale muffin. They say it's pricy because they get it local? It has to have substance to be considered anything. So whack.",0
More than a restaurant it's our favorite dessert place. Almost every dessert is absolutely amazing. All stars because of desserts. Food is fine. Service is good. Breads could have been better. Ambience is very nice.  Mixed feelings!,0
"So i have been there a half a dozen times, and this time the food was just OK. Times before it was fantastic. They are definitely not the most polite people in the world, but the food is 'usually.'",0
"If you have Jodi Arias work schedule from Jan 2008, you should get them to Juan Martinez at the Mesa, AZ prosecutor office.   Justice for Travis",0
Itallian and american design classic men's clothing. Large selection with some great sales. Very knowledgeable staff.,0
"this was not yummy or freshish or really ok. but if you insist on a california roll and happen to be trapped in the illini union at the time, how bad could it be?",0
This is good Chinese food.  The Pork Fried Rice is to die for.  Great prices and large portions you can't go wrong.,0
"Terrible, awful sandwiches. Seriously gross.  The pizza looks tasty (but looks can be deceiving).",0
Cheuvront's is a nice little spot in Downtown Phoenix and a perfect place for a date night. The wine and cheese was fantastic. I was also very impressed by the attentiveness of the wait staff. I'll definitely be going back!,0
Cult vibes + delicious lemongrass mock chicken. I try to avoid meat substitutes in general these days but Veggie House holds a special place in my heart.,0
"This is by far, my favorite mexican food place. The chips are sooo good. and everything else is good. The workers are really nice too. \n\nand they have sangria! :)",0
Food took forever. I felt like they were trying to kick us out halfway through our meal. Good food and chai tea,0
They won't deliver if you're more than 5 minutes away. Bad customer service. I don't recommend this location.,0
"Great selection, they have all the good stuff - even all natural brands.  It's difficult to resist the smell walking by.  Sometimes I've gotten free samples of their soap bars tucked inside my shopping bag.",0
Fantastic school with excellent education standards and a great Administration that's responsive to  parents.,0
"Nice bar all bottle beers, pool tables and excellent prices. The free popcorn is so good and a must have are the honey chicken sliders 100 times better then white castle.",0
I'm impressed with the cleanliness. The food was better than average and service was solid.  Pricing was right.   I'll come back.,0
Tastes like just bread. Wasn't good at all.,0
Worth checking out.  The food was good and the scene is relaxed.,0
"I appreciated the talent, but The 39 Steps had too much \""nudge nudge wink wink\"" humor without ever really being funny",0
"Meh, not the \""best\"" by far concerning the pizza. Like the fresh tomatoes but lacking in flavor from the other toppings. Maybe it's cause the crust is too heavy. There are better options especially in scottsdale.",0
Just crappy Mexican food the best part was the Mexican flag in my food. But this a disgrace to Mexico in every way possible. Every single menu item taste the same.  The salsa is watery and nasty. Don't waste your time.,0
"We stayed in the Villas in June, 2008 and plan to return in January 2009.  Fantastic staff, good food, beautiful property.",0
Love their salad and soups! Seating was pretty fast. Price is a little high but it is worth it. :),0
this place has a shuffleboard table and a nice dive bar ambiance.  Don the weeknight bartender was voted best bartender in Madison by the Isthmus' reader's choice poll.,0
"Amina has moved over to Snapdragon, so that's the spot.  Losing a star because a star left....",0
Food was ok. Ordered to go. When I got home I saw that the order was wrong and food was missing. I guess you get what you pay for.,0
"Food was great!  Service not so great...  When you're paying that much for a meal, the service should be just as good as the food.  Get the bananas foster for dessert, you won't be disappointed!",0
Excellent Tika Masala Chicken!  I would highly recommend this place for good Indian food. Nice atmosphere!,0
Went for lunch had the fish fry. Really bad over cooked just bad. Will not ever go back,0
The food was spectacular.  The atmosphere outstanding. The service was lousy.  My waiter was almost nonexistent. Had to wait 15 minutes to get the check on a Saturday afternoon.,0
"We ended up here because of the reviews we saw on yelp, and we weren't disappointed.  Great appetizers and great food!!!",0
This place argues with you allll the time.  They won't do anything for you and want to make you  pay 4 times the rates of other vets.  DO  NOT GO HERE!,0
"Friendly service, great food, neat atmosphere.  I like the heat and they don't disappoint.  This one will be a regular stop.",0
I heart King's. I've always been a fan and this one was as good as my old one in Monaca.,0
"They do have lots of flavors to chose from, but the prices are extremely high for ice cream. I was expecting to be wowed with the prices and I wasn't.",0
"When I saw this restaurant featured on diners, drive ins, and dives, it looked like the most amazing fish taco I could ever eat...it was good but just ok, I was def let down",0
"When here for lunch great food and very friendly staff :)...gave us free egg rolls,cheese wontons & a soda...I it's the small things that really count! Thanks for the great service and food!!!",0
2 words: unorganized chaos. I hate when rental car companies are offsite from the airport. Then the line wrapped around the door & they only had 2 people helping people!!! Will be avoiding this place in the future.,0
"Ate here for the first time, very impressed, let the chef chose and we were very pleased with the taste, selection and presentation.  Will be back!",0
"Professional, fast and made it sooooo easy with something that is not.  Thank you",0
"Great neighborhood sports bar!! Price is right, lots of drink specials. If you like playing pool or darts this place is for you.",0
"Best McDonald's in town. Professional, fast and consistent.  Thats really all you can ask for in a McD's.",0
The food was delicious! All you can eat shrimp really hits the spot! Worth the price for each and every shrimp in my belly. Might i add the biscuits are delicious!!,0
Good for half sandwich and soup deals here. I love the pastrami sandwich here. French onion soup is delicious and they have a full salad bar too.,0
"As much as I enjoy the always popular Starbucks and the lesser known Caribou Coffee, Smelly Cat is a wonderful change of pace.  The decor is awesome, the service is fantastic and, most importantly, the coffee is outstanding!!",0
"I've actually never been here for lunch, but hear good things. The breakfast items are good though, for sure.",0
"I love coffee! This place felt very \""home-y\"". The people behind the counter were very friendly. The coffee was alright, but I had a cappuccino. They also closed an hour before the posted time-",0
"Hard to find unless you know where it is (mysterious sounding, I know).  Staff is friendly.  Large selection of alcoholic beverages.  Good food.  Good prices.  Stop by if you get the chance.",0
Worst tacos ever. Makes me sad. In LA. There are better places in skid row. People. Stop giving these people your money these are not good at all.,0
"Didn't care for this place during my last visit. I ordered the beef fried rice and it didn't have any flavor. \n\nAlso, I needed an itemized receipt to expense the purchase and couldn't get it.",0
"so happy to see a store with contemporary furniture.  Las Vegas seems to be stuck in a time warp, every store has the same style.  We need more options for more modern tastes, this store fits the bill.",0
This is a nice relaxed local bar with good drink specials. I would have one complaint and that I don't like being there during kereoke nights.,0
"Unreal. In the top 3 best things I've ever eaten, brunch was perfect, perfect food perfect music perfect drinks and perfect company, my husband and I will certainly return anytime we are in Scottsdale.",0
"Victoria for pre-race briefing is a necessity! That girl will shave seconds off of your lap time...... This place is fun, pints, real speed, plus Race Podium sick!!!!",0
Best fried chicken I've had in the area. Workers were super nice and helpful. Only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is I thought the sides were just ok.,0
Garlic cheesy bread was amazing! Pizza was okay. Cute location and great for a date night. Staff was super friendly and the wait wasn't an issue since they offer samples and you can order drinks.,0
"Go here often with my mom for Lunch, Food is tasty and Salsa is great.  Love the Chimis and my mom likes the fish tacos.   Always look forward to eating here.",0
"Raised the prices, for there small pizzas from 6.99 to 10.99. Okay pizza I paid extra for pepperoni but they only added 4 little pieces of pepperoni. Big plus there open late",0
Good value for mony. Tasty quality and made to order. Great selection.:-),0
This place has everything! Portions are large. Don't order pho soup or Vietnam food. Everything else is good. Great Chinese food. Open late. Good service. Chinese lady explained some meals.,0
Wow this place has bad service bar tender really sucks got a card and it had someone else's name would not fix asked for something and he ignored me,0
"The spaghetti and meatballs was okay, not great, certainly not worth the 40 minute wait.",0
"was in vegas for halloween weekend, pho is still good at this place.. oh thank heaven for pho kim long :))",0
My family and enjoy the TV show a lot.  Just visited.,0
Went to have a late breakfast at about 9:30 P.M. Chicken Florentine Crepes were amazing and service was still spot on. Usually that late at night the service tends to wain. Good job and great food.,0
mini chicken pesto pizza for lunch is to die for! may look small but will be enough for two people! the cookie is amazing to!,0
is there a such thing as a nice or clean walmart?\n\nnot yet,0
Watery pasta and burnt garlic bread... Havent tried the pizza yet \nI couldve just as easily made a pasta and garlic bread way more worth while!  Not going to be lazy about it again smh,0
Good atmosphere but the California club sandwich was smothered in mayo to the point where it was inedible. My girlfriend got the ranch wrap and said it tasted like cardboard and she will eat anything. No Bueno.,0
Great for football Sunday! But a tad expensive!,0
"I live down the street, and would love to be supportive, but the last time I was there, it was average food at above average prices.",0
Very unhappy with the sales people did not do what they said they would do service department is very good,0
"Sadly, Nikko has closed their Ballantyne location.",0
Great food and friendly service. They just updated the menu and the Chicken Parm is on point.,0
Consistent and inexpensive Neds is a great place to go for lunch. The lunch special runs from 10-4 so there is plenty of time to pick up a cheap sub.,0
"Great place for doing official type things. You can fax and get notorized all at the same time... in fact this is the only place I fax, and I fax all the time. UPS peoples are good peoples! Super friendly and prompt!",0
Very knowledgeable staff that are willing to answer any question one may have! Great selection of gear and clothing!,0
"Ive been coming here since they first opened. Anthem didn't even exist. Of course, Im gonna say it, I love the outlet store :) This outlet is where I get all my cookware.  Excellent quality at bargain prices.",0
Merry-Ann's Just doesn't do it for me.  I'd just assume walk to Subway or Peking Garden when I'm looking for a cheap lunch.,0
"I want to start off by saying that the restaurant is well put. The sandwhiches and smoothies are good, but apart from the pastry, there isn't really anything too special about it.",0
"Comfy chairs, great selection at the concession stand, and decent prices. What more is there to love?",0
"Great coffee and Tea selection.  Good prices for latte's, cappuccino, ect...",0
I would try to help a real non-profit that is out to help the community that have full time jobs and not just people that can wait all day to get services.,0
"Dr Patty is the best, love her she is like family",0
I ordered an arrangement for a celebration of life and they never delivered and didn't call to warn me. Didn't receive a call until the next day. Unprofessional and unreliable!,0
We were carrying many items around and didn't get offer a shopping bag!!! Terrible services!!,0
Great service. They were prompt and professional.  I had a very short wait at exam and pick up visits. Staff was cheerful and friendly.,0
"I love everything about this place. Its always packed, and the service never slows down! These guys do the same super fast service no matter how busy it is! Awesome place, with hilarious live music.",0
"Good food... opinion finely dice your Jalepenos in your cream cheese, slices of them yuk! It wasnt spicy either... add some of the seeds.",0
"Very bland food, no flavor.  Unimpressed. Quiet atmosphere. Will not be return.",0
"I hate this airport, check in counters are so outdated and slow. Shuttle train sux, and enough of slot machines! \n\nIf I can avoid this place I would.",0
Okay food and good service.  The meatloaf was dry and the veggies had no flavor.,0
"I'm going to keep this very simple. They have the Best bagels, and cream cheese. Amazing motzo ball soup, and corned beef hash hands down.",0
"Doors locked, no furniture inside.  Apparently out of business.",0
They r closed for remodeling. It wasn't very convenient when it says 24/7  during my late night pizza craving,0
"Some good experiences and some not so good.  Shop around all the dealers, ask questions on all transactions.  Review hours.",0
Waiting 20 minutes to get one piece of wood cut in an empty store on a Friday afternoon.  Priceless!,0
"I just wasn't feeling it here.  The steak was ok, although the bleu cheese sauce was very nice.  The sides were uninspired.\n\nThe service, as is usual in this area, was very good.",0
Food is mediocre but the service is terrible. The cashiers and cooks have terrible attitudes. I'm surprised this place is still open. Keep up the good work you won't last long in summerlin!,0
"Good experience.  The dr was very detailed.  I wasn't 100% comfortable with the sonographer, but she managed to get the pictures the dr. needed...eventually.",0
"I came here for the breakfast buffet and it was meh. There was a decent variety, but the quality was poor. It's cheap though, so I guess you get what you pay for.",0
"Excellent Chinese Food!! Order on line and take it home, but make sure you call to confirm before arriving for your order because sometimes they miss it and you still have to wait. But I love their food, especially their Thai noodles.",0
"Compared to other Whole Foods locations, this one is tiny! For comparison, the Whole Foods in Las Vegas must be at least three times the size. Still, it's nice to have and it is pretty decent overall albeit pricey.",0
"A wonderful choice to eat here, wonderful seafood and steak but the mushroom Gorgonzola appetizer was to die for!!!!",0
Staff was terrible they broke our burrito 3 times they were extremely stingy with salsa and cheese. They were also very rude. They could use some manners,0
Ive been in many airports and this one could use a upgrade and open more security lines.,0
Gross... the only great thing about my meal was the chedder biscuits. I knew by the look of my meal when it came to the table I was going to get food poisoning. I WAS RIGHT.,0
"After waiting for twenty minutes for our food, we asked how much longer and the waitress told us that others were there before us, so much longer, we would have to wait. Someone else will have to review the food, because we left.",0
Luggage took FOREVER to get.  Must have been standing there for at least 30 minutes.  Doh!,0
I ordered the all you can eat pancakes and four sausage links. Coty is our server though Matt & Cindy are here too. Everything was fine. It definitely was better than Waffle House.,0
Basic Chinese food nothing special.   I've had better (see my reviews).\nSorry will not be back.,0
"Loved this place! Great vibe, decor and most importantly wine selection. Outdoor patio, friendly staff and craft beer too. Really cool and cozy place. Spent the entire evening there with friends and enjoyed the food too.  Highly recommend!",0
"The spinach pie is to die for and it's available Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays!",0
So slow will never stop here again. Plenty of places to choose from go there if in a hurry.,0
"good, cheap food.  horrible service.  sometimes super-crowded.",0
Amazing staff and great wine selection!  One of my favorite places to relax on any night. Live music on Friday an Saturday!,0
New shrimp cocktail was awesome!   Love them!,0
"We've been coming to Flamingo Palace for years and they are always just as good as we remember. Even my kids love this place, when we give them a choice to go out anywhere Flamingo Palace is always on the list.",0
Such a beautiful store! My favorite place to shop for MacKenzie-Childs and gifts for over 20 years. Everyone is always so nice and helpful! A must go if you're in the Phoenix area.,0
No bacon on my Bacon and Cheese Quarter Pounder!!!!! Kind of an essential ingredient for that particular burger....,0
"There's nothing not to like about $.85 fountain drinks, especially in the summer.",0
Service sucks. Waiter clearly on something. Food was ok but don't order very tough new York strip. Filet ok. Wouldn't come back? Bartender grumpy,0
Razz having a scream fest with his daughter at the dinner counter did not add to our enjoyment on a previous visit.,0
"Good food, good prices. The horchata is a little watered down, but if you are looking for a good place to eat after-hours, check this place out.",0
The pizza is always great here and the servers are quick. Great bar with even better food!,0
Very disappointing. Not traditional Chinese food. Not worth the money.,0
Service wasn't that great and the food was just mediocre. I haven't been inside this casino since it opened until now. My bf wasn't impressed with his meal and we had it comped off.,0
"Great stay. Great staff. Clean rooms, ample parking, well appointed suite style rooms that felt spacious. Perfect stay for out of town business and meeting with clients.\n\nWould come back.",0
"Holy smokes! This place was super packed when I went. I got the Big One Burger, and I thought the burger was mediocre. I recommend getting the onion rings instead of the regular fries.",0
"We are visiting from out of town and came across this place on Yelp.  Really good service, amazing fresh food (thin crust pizza and very yummy wings).  Nice find!",0
Service was nice and friendly. Food was bland and tasteless. Seems like a place for a much older crowd.,0
Didn't think anyone could ruin chicken strips and Fries but they sure did tonight.  Strips were burnt and fries you could nearly crack a tooth on. But the ranch was excellent,0
"Never had a better experience at a Dentist, I truly felt at home here. From the moment I walked in the door I felt comfortable and at home. The staff is so friendly and incredible I highly recommend them to everyone!!!!",0
"Better than expected. Many salad bar items, excellent corn bread. BF cleared his plate, I did too. Nothing fancy but good food! Staff very attentive.",0
"Quality of the food is always there! Love that they are open late and they full menu is available at all times. Great shake selections and prices, especially after 8pm. Delicious slush flavor combos.",0
This place is gross. They did an okay job but the whole place smelled horrible and looked really dirty! \n\nI don't know why the reviews are so high except for these people must have never gone to a clean nail salon!,0
Very cute store. Good selection for baby and a great staff. Talk to Sarah if you have questions about cribs! She was very knowledgeable.,0
Charlie's is truly a despicable establishment. They are sexist and will steal your money.,0
Only bar downtown Madison I can think of that has air hockey.  For that it gets a star.,0
"This Costco is for the restaurant owner, not the casual household shopper.",0
"Delicious and great service. We normally sit at the bar but i love the quiet atmosphere and the happy, helpful servers.",0
I had never gone to KFC before so I thought I would try it out for fun. Very blah tasting crispy chicken to be honest. Not crispy first off and barely any meat on the wing. Can't see myself ever going back.,0
Had a burger it was edible. Had strawberry shortcake it was ok....overall a very mediocre dining experience,0
Would give it 0 stars if I could. Getto place with workers that don't give a damn about customer service! Never will go here or recommend to anyone that they waste any money on this place!,0
"When we arrived there was a wait, but it was well worth it. The portions were huge and the flavors delicious. The waffles were my favorite part... I would definitely return next time I am in Phoenix!",0
"Very reasonable, good food. We had breakfast--good eggs, fresh salsa, fabulous tortillas. The only negative was the plastic silverware--it was too flexible to cut easily.",0
Wow! The tenderloin medallions were out of this world! Full if flavor and choice of topping. The service was fantastic as well. I have no complaints here.,0
Average dim sum place compare to another dim sum place in new york or washington dc.,0
Great Food and Delivers up to 5 am.,0
Decent Alternative/Rock station that has been around a while.  I like to tune in for a nice break to the other stuff played around town.,0
I tried to buy a loaf of cinnamon raison bread.  And go denied to buy it.  I will never come back to panera again!!!  Bad service employees,0
"Excellent service, good food! Recommended spot in Old Town!",0
"Your standard Thai fare, but there's much better Thai food in Phoenix (e.g. Thai Basil, Thai Rama). Their yellow curry is all chicken, hardly any onions or potatoes.",0
Always perfect and fresh EVERY time!  I LOVE the Hong Kong Chicken.,0
"Good beer and chicken fingers. Great place to people watch, watch games, and of course beer!  Quick service with a smile!",0
I really don't have the words right now. Losing my nephew to a senseless act of violence..,0
"Great location, short shuttle ride to/from the airport.   They have super sport cars to rent if you have the $$...I only wish I could get upgraded to them!",0
"Awesome dinner, be ready for a good kick! Margaritas were great too",0
We stayed here on vacation and enjoyed our stay. Everything was very nice and clean. Loved the pool area. The rooms are a bit out of date but the resort overall was great!,0
Maybe I am too picky with my Fish & Chips.  These ones sucked too!  We keep getting gift cards for this places but I have not had a meal I was happy with here.  The water is good.,0
"Flowers stunk to high heaven with all the chemicals they sprayed on them to try to make dead flowers look fresh. It didn't work, they looked like dead flowers. Absolutely the worst bouquet I've ever bought. Don't bother.",0
We've been coming here for years.  The food is ALWAYS great and I agree that the service is great without hovering.  Their lunch menu is the best value as well as the best chinese food in town,0
Horrible wait. Horrible service. First and last time will ever patronize.,0
I miss the ciabatta bun burger that had that awesome sauce. Please bring it back.,0
"This is a nice little place that has some pretty good sandwich's. I got the vegetarian turkey sandwich they also have vegetarian cheese steak (unfortunately no vegan cheese), but its nice to have some veg options.",0
"Moto does everything good, but it never rises to great. They have an eclectic menu and there's tons for non-sushi eaters, too. Good value for dollar spent and usually walk away full and happy.",0
You get what you pay for - no-frills basics but it works. The night staff could use some customer service training.  I have no excuse to stay here again and certainly would pursue other options if looking in the area.,0
Very disappointed.  Entire cake went to waste and was not enjoyable.  Party spoiler.,0
"It's like Vegas here.\n\nFull of flashing lights and noises, but no real content or anything to make you stick around too long, but it looks so fun from a distance.",0
"flies everywhere, place is dirty and food not cooked well.",0
Would have been five stars if the service had been better. For a Saturday night pretty empty so was surprised to see it take a while to get service. Food was fantastic as usual!,0
Had escargot for the first time.. Interesting not sure ill ever try that again but the salmon was good,0
"They make the best shrimp fried and chicken fried rice you'll find in Arizona. The area may be rough, but don't let that deter you from trying their food! Great food and great service!",0
"This is the best hotel in Downtown for sure. It's very luxurious and has a great layout.  With being on the center of Freemont Street and tons of bars and dining options, this is the place to be at when Downtown.",0
"Basic Italian fare in a chain-style atmosphere. The service is excellent and you can draw on the tables. Nice food presentation, you can dine here without breaking the budget. Excellent desserts.",0
"Very bad service. Book one for 8:15am, never shows up. When called, said the driver stuck in traffic? but it is already 2 hours late and there is no traffic at all.",0
"I ordered bagel with strawberry, they put almond.... If you ordered bagel thing they give you regular bagel???? What happened?",0
The food here is expensive but super worth eating healthy and feeling good about yourself. The customer service is amazing.,0
"The queens here are so rude including the fat ugly ones. If you're looking for bottoms and more bottoms, This is the place for you.",0
I have never had an airline deny me when I make it to the gate 5 minutes before scheduled take off. US Airways lost my business for life. Worst airline ever!,0
"Been here several times.  They always mess up my order, especially at the drive-thru.  Skip this one and drive 3 minutes north to the McD's at Alma and Queen Creek. It's much better.",0
"The food is ok, but the people that work there could not give a rip. The one in Champaign is much better.",0
I ordered PHO #31 with extra meat. Well I got 1 ounze of chicken the same that comes with a standard order. This happened on 2 seperate occassions. Will not be back!!,0
"My favorite place to take the kids to lunch. Also great for quick \""to-go\"" work lunches. Sign up for Panera Rewards. I always end up getting a surprise treat from the rewards I have collected.",0
Ambiance was nice. Steak (pecan sirloin) was tasty. Waitresses were friendly. However was not overly impressed with restaurant. It was indistinguishable from other steakhouses.,0
I was fairly disappointed with this zoo. Signage was unclear. Many of the exhibits were on loan. The petting zoo consisted of a large pen of goats.,0
First timer at Mimi's Cafe. I was extremely hungry.. The service was alright but the time bring out the food was too long. It's okay... Solid 3.5..,0
Do not go here at all. The people that run this place are not nice to customers at all.,0
"A pretty casual hotel restaurant. Because it's a hotel restaurant, you'll get your meal overpriced with a limited selection. At least parking is free in the lot.",0
"I've been ordering here for years. Always had good experiences, except for tonight. The manager was extremely rude about me receiving cold pizza.  She definitely needs more training and needs to be kept off the phone!",0
The worst place I have ever been. The service was horrible and the food was even worse. If u are someone who values customer service this isnt the place for you.,0
Western Bacon Cheeseburger. Enough said.,0
Pretty good food at an acceptable price. They seem to have a good beer selection too. The server was very friendly and responsive. Good place.,0
Great location; friendly staff. Nothing above and beyond to report.,0
This is the best restaurant in town for breakfast  and lunch!!! Good home cooking!,0
"Nadya is an old school, from the ground up, tailoring seamstress.  She does beautiful work! I recommend her for ANYONE, man or woman, who is looking for quality work.",0
"Crappy service and crappy pizza with barely any toppings, we ordered ahead. The Little Caesars by us is much, much better and sells a good product. We won't be returning to this location.",0
The place is a dump and the staff is rude and inconsiderate. Avoid this place like the plague...because they have it there.,0
Food was amazing. Portion sizes were perfect for the price. Not a place for children.,0
bought shoes and then exchanged them for diff ones.  pro tip:  clean them before you exchange them.  it'll save you a lot of hassle.,0
"This place is terrible, there food was cold and i had an undercooked chicken it was horrible the quantity on my plate was very low the pricing is crazy too overpriced absolute bad dinner",0
Food is decent. But the hostess is simply awful. She is rude and mean and surprisingly makes the whole experience negative. \n\nWe will not be returning because of her.,0
Great service.  Nice selection.  If everything runs smoothly with my rentals this place will get 5 stars easy.  Ill keep everyone posted.,0
Good location but seriously how much would it cost to put cushions in the armrests...,0
3 stars for the food and -2 for the service. They have pathetic service and a shameless staff.,0
"If you want a dog and are in the area, this is a pretty good call. Having said that, it is probably not worth a special trip. You can find a better hot dog or brat at a ballpark or in the supermarket.",0
"Wonderful old-style country French. Dinner combined with restaurant.com a real bargin, allowing a better bottle of wine. Very attentive service, even from the elderly owner. Perfect for that special occaison.",0
"Just your typical Target store, nothing special about this one.  Only good thing is that this location is close to my work place so if I need anything for my job, I can easily drive over here and get it.",0
Great food! Clean. Basic. Friendly staff and reasonably priced. What more do you need?,0
Fabulous crab cakes and oysters.  Thus place feels like dining in a tree house with rock'n music. The patio is fun and casual.,0
"Service at the bar was great, the wine was great, but the food wasn't that great! Your typical franchise Italian restaurant!!",0
"Good for a cheap date. Food is okay, service is good!",0
"I special ordered a 2014 calendar from this store and they never called me to tell me it was not available or anything. Once again, horrible customer service!",0
It's way too loud in here. I prefer the Central Ave. location.,0
"The bread they serve is very dry.  What would one expect from the only \""free\"" item served?\n\nThe Cajun Ribeye is incredible and worth the $49.  It basically melts in your mouth.",0
This is a very fun airport. There are plenty of ways to kill time and money with all the shops and the slot machines everywhere. Also has plenty of spots to eat and drink at every terminal and close to almost all gates.,0
Nice bar to grab food and a beer at. Service from bartenders is mediocre. Atmosphere is Irish-feeling but feels kinda meh,0
They serve Pepsi.  Got horribly sick about 30 minutes after I finished my meal.,0
30 minutes to make 4 fish tacos and they screwed up the order.  Never again.,0
"Have to agree; probably the worst place for \""seafood\"" around. And the corporate atmosphere reminds me of outback or chilis.... enough said.",0
"this is the best place in town,my burger is always done the way I like it med rare and the service is the best,Thanks",0
Friendly and delicious! It's like having a friend for breakfast.,0
Worst salsa I have ever tasted. They also would not modify the menu to fit my request. What kind of place doesn't modify a menu for a customer. I will not return!,0
Great sushi. We always sit at the preparer bar location to watch as our sushi is made. Our server was excellent and talking to the sushi preparer was very interesting. We experimented with a few different dishes and each was delicious.,0
"Just like every eatery, it is hit or miss with the service.  However this time, what's notable is the shrinkage of the menu and the quality of service.",0
Unfortunately the reason why this place  has gone down hill is because it's no longer what it used to be.,0
Went to this place for lunch. My wife order a wrap and I order a salad. Very nice food. The sweet potato fries are wonderful. My smoked duck break salad is wonderful too. Highly recommended.,0
"Very friendly staff, great location! The pharmacist made sure I knew everything about my medication and thoroughly answered all my questions! Great place to go!",0
By the far the most friendly chipotle I've been too! Everyone was more than helpful not to mention the food was amazing and fresh!,0
Delish subs! Had an Italian sub today. Fresh everything! So much better than Subway.,0
Two of the the soups look like they've been sitting there all day your server never even greets you or gets anything for you so why tip?,0
"I only came in here because Alice Cooper ROCK, however was not at all impressed with the food and service.",0
"Pricey, but the quality presented is well worth it. They offer catering as well and have a giant deli-type selection. Plus, they deliver!",0
"Came here for breakfast and the food was great. I had bacon, eggs, hash browns, and toast for only $5. The bacon was excellent quality and everything was cooked to perfection. I'll be back again!",0
"The location looks questionable but they have VERY delicious pho. The place is clean, the staff are friendly and the food is yummy.",0
"This place used to be good, but that was years ago.\n\nToday it's very dirty with food that just doesn't cut it.\n\nThe salsa is still good so that gave it a star.",0
It ok food.  I've had better Mexican food.  Portion is small and little high price for fast Mexican food.,0
This place has the best USO I have ever been to!,0
"Outdated and mediocre, did not live up to the Diners Drives and Dives hype.  Wouldn't eat there again although it wasn't terrible.  Service was also average.",0
"The food is run of the mill Mexican food - decent and filling. However, the service is slow. The waitresses are friendly, but a weekday lunch with few customers should not take an hour.",0
Easily the best Chicago hot dogs in the henderson area. Nothing around really compares. Had a lot of items from here and everything is always fresh and the service is great! You can't go wrong with the Chicago Hot dog!,0
Food was good and service was great. I would go back:),0
I came to The Men's Club of Charlotte with DJ Evo and some friends. We had a great time. Leah was our Bartender. She was excellent and helpful with recommending some great drinks. Had a great time.,0
"Not worth the price, much better courses around for the money!",0
The only place I go to for sweet and sour chicken. Its the best!,0
"This store is smaller than the PetSmarts, however they carry a great variety for a few dollars cheaper. Staff seem knowledgeable and were very helpful.",0
"Can't say I've ever had a great experience here, but they have a good selection and fair pricing so I put up with their crappy service and the occasional returned item.",0
"Great breakfast spot, but be prepared to wait...especially on the weekends. Still, it's worth the wait.",0
"Great employees, Lobby and breakfast area where nice.  Good food,  but rooms need a serious renovation.  \n\nBut it's clean...",0
"This location is not the best one i have seen.  They only have a few pieces of good cardio equipment and the time limit is 20 min.  so for people that want to do the stairmaster for longer, it sucks.",0
Big 5 gets five stars....because it is the only place in the valley that I have consistently found Fila shoes for a great price....enough said.,0
We arrived at the door at 9:04pm and we were told that they closed at 9pm. Our party of 5 went elsewhere. Hard to below they could not use the extra business. Very short sighted imho.,0
How does a new battery take 3 hours to install? \nI had 1/2 a mind to push my dead car to Advance Auto,0
One of my favorite Chinese spots. High quality food and good service.  Its a bit expensive but it's worth it.,0
If you are looking for pizza on the sweeter side with friendly servers this place stays consistent in its tastyness!,0
"Some kid answers the phone yesterday 45 minutes before their posted closing time \""Umm...yah we're like closed\"" he didn't even say hello? I would have felt better if he simply didn't answer the phone.",0
Very good breakfast. You can tell a lot of care is taken with the food. Very friendly staff and nice casual atmosphere.,0
Nice place to visit in spring time frame.  The prices are affordable and the views are breathtaking.,0
"A funky old house, I believe, converted to restaurant.  The waffles are amazing (and we eat real waffles at home all the time), the chicken was just as you would expect...wonderful.  A real treat!",0
For those looking for a quality sub and can't find it at a chain restaurant this is the spot. Subs are priced a little high compared to a chain but you get what you pay for.,0
Ok this place looks a little scary not in the best neighborhood but let me tell you there chicken fingers are amazing and then get a regular hut so good n cheap.,0
This place is awesome! Staff is always friendly and food is always good! Wings are good and the crab puffs are amazing!,0
I've been coming to this place for 3 years and I've had good customer service so far. I've ordered a few minutes before closing and they've accommodated me.,0
Pizza taste like cardboard and games are horrible. The prizes are just crappy as they get.,0
"Close proximity to the Tempe Mission hotel and very quick service.\nNice table area, with lots of seating.",0
Decent Thai food. It doesn't stand out as anything special but the food is good! And locations make it an easy place to go to.,0
Now that Border's has closed they are really the only game in town.  I buy most of my books online at Amazon but come here to browse and then buy my travel guides.,0
"Off strip casino, supposedly 'where the locals go' but the machines were tight so I think that's just an urban legend. Dirty and very very smoky. Sketchy clientele.",0
Great mexican food and great salsa! They have an excellent breakfast burrito and lots of lunch specials. I love going here but the food is so intense i usually want a nap afterwards.,0
"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. This is a lovely, elegant hotel. However the thing that makes it really stand out is the quality of customer service. The staff are simply wonderful - professional, frriendly, attentive.",0
This is the best Pei Wei in the area. Food taste great 95% of the time! They do need to improve on keeping the dining room clean and sanitized.,0
Been in this branch a couple of times now and the staff is always nice and very helpful,0
We love to go here. Always for a special occasion. Food is delicious and we always have so much fun.,0
Come here for breakfast!!! It is nothing fancy but if you're looking for a great meal for a nice price Tryon House is the place to go. Get there early because this place get busy on the weekends for breakfast.,0
Just watched a guy in a SF Giants cap flip burgers with his glove. Gross.,0
Not sure where the rave reviews come from.  This buffet is pretty damn decent but I read that it was the best in Vegas.  That title I still give to Bellagio.,0
I love this place. My favorite stop for lunch. The food is always fresh. Not only can I get lunch but also shop for dishes to cook at home. Hope they never leave!,0
"Excellent food & friendly service! We will definitely be back! The guac is amazing by the way, definitely a must try starter.",0
"I walked in at 5;20 pm tonight and was out of there at 6:15 pm having had an EKG, chest X-ray exam etc. Everyone was kind, respectful, professional and efficient. I would highly recommend them.",0
"Edible, but nothing to write home about.  Had a taco salad, pretty generic, not much flavor",0
"This place is not a bad place for a bowling alley. The food here isn't that terrific, but what can you expect? Had a group party here and it was a fun place to go. Overall not a bad place to hang out.",0
I like that it's right downtown by my house.\n\nI dislike that it's mostly vacant.,0
They must have made some changes from the comments below because I really have had an excellent experience going to this Prestige Cleaner location. Staff is super friendly and dry cleaning is always done on time. I'd highly recommend this location.,0
"Don't go here! I think the Owner of the bar went through gene therapy to revert back to a primitive state. Don't give her any of your business, because she \""-don't need your money you mother f**kers\"".",0
Great interactive museum!  We have visited twice since moving from TX.\n\nLoved the dinosaurs.,0
The liquor board needs to do something about this place. The owner is a complete intoxicated fool and it's becoming a problem. Stay away.,0
Service was terrible. Food wasn't the greatest either. There are a lot better Mexican restaurants on the area.,0
"I so love the egg, ham, and cheese burritos and they're served all day!",0
Love their spicy black bean dip and their black bean and pineapple quesadilla... mmmm can't get enough of their black bean.,0
"Great food, great service. Quality is always top notch. What you pay is a little more but it is worth it.",0
"Breakfast food is excellent, so is the service and restaurant.",0
"Mostly dudes\nnice theme, schoolgirls are nice\ncrap music.\nthe decor and theme are unique\nthe kinda place to go there once to say you've been, any more will drive you mad",0
The happy hour on the weekend is a smoking deal.   Two or three people can get drinks and sushi for around $25.   Staff is always rocking and fast.  Great ambience and people watching too.,0
"Nice hole-in-the wall style sports bar, although bigger than most hole-in-the wall type places. Good beer selection. I did not eat there.",0
"This place, like all other downtown places, smell like piss and bums.  No thanks.",0
Went in for a perm and the people were very rude. It is in a hidden out of the way location. Maybe the chain headquarters put it there on purpose. Hide the worst people in an area where no one will visit!,0
"Good food but stay close to the bathroom!\n\nMexican food is great, super greasy and great after a night at the bar.",0
This place never seems to disappoint me. I'm always extremely satisfied on every visit. The food is great so as the service. It's a great family restaurant and caters crowd of every kind,0
"food not hot, no flavor. people were nice.",0
"I really enjoyed the service I received at this Outback. I know that restaurants are often busy and I usually feel like the personal, friendly service is sacrificed but we were treated very well.",0
"Love the phone application to make yoqur reservation on your way to the salon... my son got a great haircut... I will come back, when I am in town... Veronica is WONDERFUL!",0
"Had a birthday party here, and it was great! We all enjoyed our food, and the servers were very nice when we stayed so late!",0
Cool place to eat. Awesome cocktails as well as food. I love the coconut cocktail and the Ikan Rica Rica. They just opened a bar.,0
My friends and I still call it 'Los' and it's my favorite burrito spot. Bean & cheese burrito is the best ever but the entr\u00e9es are legit too.,0
"Big beers, peanuts and a decent breakfast?  Enough said..",0
Place isn't and won't ever have the same taste since they switched owners.,0
Pretty good homestyle Tex-Mex.  The salsa is outstanding.  Just don't go here for lunch unless you are able to take a nap afterwards.,0
"Food was great, quoted a half hour wait ended up being half that long.  Service left a bit to be desired sittingon the patio but at least they weren't over bearing.",0
"The food was tasty, but the service was tasteless.",0
"They didn't frisk me, which is a negative or a positive depending on what kind of mood I'm in, and the fella that checked my ticket was a sweet pea.",0
I really don't know what the hype is about.  I was quite underwhelmed with this restaurant.,0
Food AND service were OUTSTANDING!! Had the heirloom tomato and mozz special appetizer and linguini. Mom had lamb chops. We enjoyed every bite. Jillian gave EXCELLENT service. Worth every penny!!!,0
Tonight I was served a gyro which the meat was burnt with a black char on it.  I've been eating there less frequently as the quality seems to be slipping.   I will not be returning after this.,0
Try Daves new juicy burgers.  Holy hell they are good!!,0
Love this place! I can't seem to stop ordering the New Mexico Enchiladas each time I go. I really need to branch out but I love them so.,0
"Great store. Staff is professional and friendly.  Only downfall, during the summer,  upon entering the store, it smells funky. I cannot describe the smell, just I recommend they clean their A/C ducts??",0
"The Lasagna is amazing.  However, I am not impressed with the pizza or salad.",0
Horrible service!!!! If you do not have your party there then they do not seat anyone!! The are rude and very snobby for a service that should be great. Food is fine if you can get past the service :/,0
"Always great, knowledgeable service when they work on our regulators. Great people working there who never try to oversell you on equipment and their salt water, heated pool is awesome for refresher courses!",0
Photography~ Pictures take almost 2 weeks to arrive for cd/pictures. Not able to view pics on iPhone/iPad. Good grief!,0
"You wait OVER an hour every time. Parking lot is filled to the freaking brim every time, and they blame the wait on something new every time. Don't waste your time.",0
Pretty good bar food.  It's conveniently located and a fun atmosphere.,0
"Eh\nInteresting menu, but I found the food to be rather mediocre\nEven compared to the Rock Bottom at Desert Ridge\n\nI do enjoy their happy hour beer though, so 2 stars for a good microbrew!",0
I've been going here for over 6 years and hate to get my eyebrows done anywhere else! Ask for Annie she does the best eyebrows in Charlotte!! Mani-pedis are always great as well and they just got new massage chairs!,0
"Good lunch specials. Small clean dine in area, friendly server was helpful with my wife's restricted diet.  \n\nWe were pleased and will return for more. Very notable was the soup, delicious.",0
"Primanti bros has the best corned beef sandwich in the east, and the coleslaw, fries and tomato right on the sandwich made it totally unique. Oh and they also have a great craft beer selection.",0
"Loved it. Had fried tofu and the green beans with minced pork. Both were delicious...plenty of leftovers. Nice, friendly, chatty service -- I lucked into a slow hour :) Definitely recommend it and plan to come back",0
"my friend and Ifeel the burgers and shakes were worth the fast, the good staff, and all the hype. The fries were average.",0
"Qualtire replace water lines throughout house, had an issue over a year later and they came out and repaired at no charge. Karen was a great help\nAppreciate the service",0
Wow. Ordered 3 dishes - all great. Blueberry muffins and the press tuna sandwich is to die for. I'm digging this place - perhaps my top 3 breakfast joint worldwide.,0
Food is great!!! service is awful. After I ordered my meal the clerk asked me are u sure you don't want to order from the under 500 calorie meal.  Seriously,0
Good ol' fashioned diner food with friendly service.  Though they could use better coffee from a local roaster.,0
"So delicious.  Try their tea, it tastes like Christmas.",0
I bought a Fry Daddy at the Corningware Outlet. That was the highlight of my visit.,0
"Had some pretty good wines. Look out for the cherry though, It taste like cough syrup",0
Excellent food! Excellent service! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a great meal with great service.,0
The worst service they attended the Anglo first I was there with the family and the customers that were eating were starring at us and talking shit behind our backs so uncomfortable never going to this place again first and last,0
"Been twice now, owner and counter service very friendly.  The food is ok when you have a need for Chinese American food fix.  Deep fried items are REALLY deep fried... small-ish crunchy bits of chicken kind of thing.",0
"Generic chain food, most of which is made from frozen out of a bag ingredients.  Don't waste your money or time.  TGI Friday's or Applebee's with a Caribbean theme.",0
"Food is great, specials are always a good deal and atmosphere is amazing.",0
Nothing special about this place. Great location but the facilities are a little tired.,0
I too got the 2 slice and a drink deal.  I had the pineapple and ham pizza slices.  The sauce had a nice tang to it and I got ham and pineapple in every bite.  A good lunch deal.,0
"You have to love this Charlotte classic. Way laid back, killer patio. Cold beers and a casual place to chill all day.",0
Worst pizza I've had it's insane how they managed to still stay open,0
Food was bland and not very good.  Didnt even have any hot sauce.  Place could use an update on the decor as well...,0
"Sorry folks, Chuy's is no longer open at this location. It is now a restaurant called \""Bisquits\""' serving breakfast and lunch.",0
Best ice cream ever..worth every penny and they are very nice!!,0
This is the closest convenience store near my house and I really like the staff here. They open up new registers as soon as they see the lines getting long and they're really helpful and friendly.,0
"Won best greasy spoon in Madison, yet has vegan options and bean salad as an alternative to fries! Yes, a great retro diner, but with modern options. And a dessert case. Awesome!",0
I go to Lotus foods for the fresh chow mein noodles and the selection of Japanese pop.,0
"If you are 60+ and have $5, this is the place for you. The food is greasy, the decor is stuck in the 70's, the waitress was a bitch. Just horrible all around.",0
"It is pretty loud in here, but other than that I like the food. The chicken sandwich and the fries are great.",0
"Everyone here goes above and beyond!  Convenient, courteous and efficient.  If you're in the neighborhood, stop by to say hello to Dong, Vic and Stacey.",0
Great place to come and have a drink and watch a few sports games or bet on the horses. They also have otb  on dog racing. The food is average bar food.,0
I am very happy with the service I have received in the past. I am going back today to get four more tires.,0
manager Veronica delivers the best service. I ordered a dish that was too salty and she was courteous all the way and made sure I got a different dish. Thank you for the excellent service!,0
Went to the Avondale location and we had pollo fundido and the spinich enchilada.  Food and drinks were really good and service was great!,0
$79 for 10 shirts and a suit! WOW that's what I get for trying to support my local business!  RIP OFF ALERT!,0
"I like this one much better than the one on Serene. The isles are much bigger, I didn't bump into anyone once!",0
Visiting Tempe and was just walking off dinner and decided to stop in for a beer.  Wound up smoking a good cigar and having a few pints.  Very friendly staff,0
"Great sandwiches. Service is excellent and they have a wide variety of sandwiches, hot and cold.\n\nWill revisit again in the near future.",0
"Sucked, ordered a BBQ Chicken Sicilian pizza and they gave me a regular. There was no BBQ sauce in it. The seafood calzone had more bread and grease then actual meat. And the service was shit. No more from me.",0
"We went back tonight and the food was great, service from Ky was amazing and the music was pleasant.  Excellent comeback from a rough night.",0
"My weekday swim hangout.  Big, clean, and kid friendly.  The year round heated pool got me here.  Understandable, it was trimmed back a few months.  It's still great.",0
I ordered a sausage pizza. It was delivered on time. However the pizza was cold and  I struggled on eat the dough even with a knife.  Very disappointed.  We order from them quite frequently,0
"Way too main stream and over-priced. Coffee is not as good as what would be found at a local shop where the employees actually care. Employees were rude and slow, even when there were not many customers waiting.",0
Very high quality food in a good atmosphere.  Didnt blow me away to get the 5th star and the service was terrible even though the restaurant was near empty.,0
"Servers are chatting, not paying attention to tables. I can see my salad is ready at the window. Worst serves ever.",0
Good destination for pizza. Would frequently go there for a slice at lunch when I worked in the area. Nice New York style pizza with a crisp crust.,0
"I don't know where to start, the biscuit I keep hearing about is tasteless flat and dry, the chicken is soaked in oil. The cajun beans weren't bad though. Its just not my thing.",0
Great tacos always fresh and flavorful.  Lunch is quick and the patio is great.,0
Good enough place to get comfort food. Nothing special but gets the job done.,0
The only reason this gets 2 stars is because my kids love this place. The pizza is Terrible. The games pretty crappy and run down many of them not working properly.  Why can't places for kids serve better quality food?,0
it's a healthy breakfast all day looking joint.  Remind me of sunrise cafe in Vegas.   very friendly service and prompt.  Definitely a good spot to go.,0
"Everyone is so helpful, specially Lynn in the window treatment department.  She is very knowledgeable and eager to help you!",0
"After leaving the hood when it was dangerous and not gentrified and full of urban/hipsters, I came back around, glad to see the same guys working there, they even recognized me. Same great prices and service.",0
"Amazing place! The staff always goes above and beyond. They carry many different items and costume pieces, accessories, SFX makeup etc. There are so many great options.",0
"Great customer service at lunch. Order the lunch special and 6 other customers get served before me. Wait 45 minutes then get up to leave. Am asked \""Do I want that to go?\"" Can anyone say @DirtyDrummer?",0
Seriously!!!!! This place is the best EVER!!! You need to get down here and try this pizza and garlic knots!!! Best Service and BEST Food EVER!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!!!!!!,0
Good food. Worst dining experience ever. The waiter was extremely rude. Will never go here again.,0
"Nice Giant Eagle, not as nice as their new Market Districts, but you can look at this Giant Eagle and see how they came up with the Market District Idea and rolled with it. Fresh made sushi, good cheese selection, awesome bakery.",0
"Service wasn't very good, and their (advertised) delivery was not available (because the delivery drivers car broke down). Maybe as a sit in it would be ok but I was not impressed",0
Nice local place! Great late night specials and the bbq ribs are fall off the bone great.  The bartenders are friendly and know how to make a great drink.,0
I just love going to the airport and sitting at the bar to people watch. It is a great place to meet new people. although I got bumped off of my flight it was a good time.,0
Great people running a great clean corner store gas station! I always enjoy going to Francis & Sons!,0
"Absolute worst wings I've ever had, I'm 43, may be the first time I've ever asked for my money back. Soggy, and no sauce.",0
Great location!  Close to shops and theatre.  Nice staff.,0
Lived here for 6 yrs and never tried this place. That was a big mistake ad this place is great. We will definitely be back!,0
"Very cool place.   Excellent wine list, great friendly service and a smart, friendly crowd.  One of our favorite places in Scottsdale.",0
We love it here. Staff is friendly and food is good. The pesto pasta with sausage is very delicious. Portions are big so bring your appetite.,0
Love this del taco location the food is always fresh the customer service is great and the food is always made on time and they never once messed up my orders each time I came here.,0
"I loved my everything about my experience at Ruth Chris.  It was a bit expensive, but the service was outstanding and the food was delicious.  \nI would definitely go again.",0
"THe food here was not good. We ordered several dishes including the dumplings, seafood, and noodles. I didnt like any of it and would definitely not go back",0
i don't know what to say their double chicken bowl deal is delicious! you get a lot of food here for your money i think plus the salsa bar is pretty dang good itself!!!.,0
"Great selection of titles, affordable pre-pay rental blocks, convenient location if you are a U of I student or work on campus. I'm so glad this place is here!",0
"When it's 2 for 1 then any food is good, the food is ok but better with 2 for 1!",0
"In addition to the best Pizza, Wings, Fish Fry, and Roast Beef, they also make their own dressing.  Best in town.",0
Horrible service! Crappy food! We waited 45 min at our table before we even got any type of food.,0
This place is always understaffed.  You can wait in line to check out for 20 min. or more.  Also their check-out process seems less than efficient.,0
it's a great adventure when they have free admission days sponsored by qwest.\n\na membership might be a great deal for those that like to exercise but like interesting views.,0
The typical chain restaurant. This is to Chinese what Olive Garden is to Italian. Except that Olive Garden is a better value for money. Ambience and service are very good. Food is okay. I wouldn't particularly recommend it for vegetarians.,0
I LOVES me some Waffle House (the best hashbrowns in town IMHO) but this location is not their best.,0
Elvis renewed our vows and it was amazing!  Elvis was fabulous.  highly recommend it - what a great experience. very professional.,0
We saw the chef dump used chili sauce back into the container on the table after the customers left. Bleh :(,0
Very sloppy! No attention the polish is all over my fingers so disappointing and aggravating that now I'm going to have to pay more money else where to get them redone,0
"went for sunday brunch.   very nice, a little pricey but nice venue.",0
I need to deduct another star for their use of styrofoam cups.  Green definitely it's not.,0
"Stinky, black mold on peeling wall paper, peeling gross paint all over hotel room door. Scary place.",0
"Was expecting more fusion dishes, ended up being just another Korean restaurant. Food is pretty good for Korean, but we came here specifically for the interesting element of Hawaiian + Korean. And we saw none of that on the menu.",0
"Not my favorite restaurant, but its something besides taco bell. Tried the nachos last time, they were good. Their tacos were kind of soggy. I dont like their salsas, prob my biggest complaint.",0
Wednesday night is 1/2 priced appetizer night. This means half price chicken wings!!! These are the most delicious wings in town. Try the salt and pepper they are unreal!,0
Took excellent care of my baby when I brought her in for a wellness checkup post adoption from MCACC.,0
This place pretty much sucks..this is my first time staying in a old type hotel coming to vegas...hooter girls were pretty much nasty.not like the ones out in cali...won't be staying here again...,0
Amazing deep dish pizza!!! Family owned and operated...the owners and the kids are absolutely charming! Best place to get a great pizza in Phoenix!!!,0
Don't walk by.  Run by this place and don't look back.  The worst Mexican food in Phoenix.  Absolutely no flavor. The only thing going for it is the friendly wait staff.,0
Fast tasty cheap. Parking is rough. Public parking lot on East side will save you from ticket stress risking leaving it in the circle. Bike is perfect.,0
Mediocre Asian food made to accommodate american taste.  Ok tasting but not authentic.  Do not like the ambience but it is conveniently located very close/on UW-Madison campus.,0
Extended hours to 10PM in the summer.  They now have smoothies/orange julius.  Previous comments stand and prices went up even more!,0
I have complained twice about not  wearing gloves! I made the manager re-make my order wearing gloves. they are getting better but I suggest you go in and look in the kitchen just to make sure the person is wearing gloves!,0
Love the Mexican Chocolate Cinnamon Latte!!! Breakfast is always phenomenal. Service is always friendly and well paced. Price is on point for the area. Great little spot in the art district!,0
"The chipotle chicken panini was delicious and large.  Very hot, flavorful, juicy, and reasonably priced (especially for an airport).  They even gave me a delicious chocolate chip cookie.  Definitely recommend.",0
"On a Friday night restaurant was busy, but the service was top drawer. Food was very good and we will be back. Prices reasonable.",0
I can't think of anything due to my food coma but it was all five stars!  The blackberry sorbet was a perfect finish.,0
Horrible. This guys prices are unreal. The place looks like the D.O.D. Threw up.,0
The food was descent but it was seriously overpriced and they didn't give us any refills on our sodas. Service was okay but it took a long time for the food come out.,0
"I have only eaten one thing at HQ. I love the Mexico City burger.  Green chili, bacon,  cheese   Worth the drive from Casa Grande",0
"Great food, very impressive draught beer selection with lots of excellent local beers. Waitresses were outstanding. Our regular stop to and from Raleigh.",0
Excellent juicy (not greasy) carne asada tacos. You know it's the real deal when it has only cilantro and onion! The salsas are also excellent,0
"Dr. Grade exudes professionalism, I appreciate her attention and detail when I have an appointment. I have never had a doctor that I was completely comfortable with, I would recommend her and the office to everyone.",0
Always good pizza and friendly staff!  For a fast food kind of pizza I've yet not to like a pizza from this location!,0
"Super duper friendly service, but I am here to eat, and it is mediocore food at best.",0
Good food!  I ordered a chicken lavosh and it came with a bonus side salad.  Despite being packed waiter was attentive.  I would go back!,0
Nothing special. Truly a dive. Almost a dump. But nice people and ok food. Drove 27 miles to check it out because of the TV show. Wasn't worth it.,0
Great location!  I love that you can substitute burger with a veggi patti and that they have gluten free bread.  Love love love the smiley cookies :),0
Had the BBQ sandwich on Focaccia. Really good!,0
"BEWARE: These guys will mess up your bank account, and will provide a horrible customer service to go with it. They will only sign you up for insurance without your prior approval.",0
Peanut Butter filled pretzels are on my short list of endurance event foods.    The best combination of salty and sweet and caloric density that you need for a long haul. \n\nMmm.....,0
McDonalds food served by English language challenged people. Enough said.,0
"I seriously don't know why people love this place so much, the food here is horrible. The rice is never cooked properly.. And it's not even Asian food. It's fake asian food. I never come here anymore.",0
"Efficient service and decent food. The snadwiches and coffee are great. However, it would not qualify as a true brnch place.",0
Very cool place...huge number of craft and local beers available in their beer is good too.  Very fun and a little different from most other bars (which is good)...and a nice place to take others when visiting Phoenix...,0
I ended up paying 1k for a crown that they said would be covered by my insurance. Then they billed me $50 for not going back to them.,0
The service is fast. The staff is friendly. The pizza is good for something fast. It's cheap and you get what you pay for...but do you guys always have to burn the pizza?,0
"Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.",0
I really liked this place.  The food was good and the service was great.  I'd come back for sure.,0
"Terrible service,  wings are not good and the girls aren't even that hot. Would highly recommend not coming here. I personally will never come back",0
"Had a good, hearty meal here while visiting. We ordered a cobb salad and chicken pot pie - both very tasty. Big booths and friendly service.",0
"Always tasty with enormous portions. They recently remodeled to accommodate the crowds. They are also open 24/7. Nightly specials have all been good so far, especially bbq night.",0
"These guys know their keys! I have brought in at least 2 very complicated older car keys, one of which was broken in two pieces! These guys helped me every time. Highly recommend. Very reasonable prices, in my opinion.",0
Food was very good and consistent with the other times we've eaten at Roy's in other cities. But the wait for the food took a LONG time! This restaurant is located inside the Marriott resort. Beautifully decorated with indoor and outdoor seating.,0
"Not clean, room sure could use a coat of paint and updating.",0
"The check receptionist was \""OK\"", The check out receptionist was much more welcoming. The nurse was great and Jennae Porter PA-C was awesome! Would def refer and I plan on making this my Derm place!",0
"This location is great.  We have been here a couple times, both with big and small parties and each time we were waited on quickly and our food was great.",0
Been with AAA for almost two decades and I'm very satisfied with them! Jennifer our agent is awesome! She makes sure that we're taken care of! Thanks,0
The best Vietnamese I have tried in Pittsburgh. The Tufu lemon from the appetizers was just perfect. I found the place from Yelp.com and I would definitely recommend it! Very inexpensive too! I really like it!,0
"Very friendly place. I go for breakfasts and other than the very dry cooked hash browns, the food is good.  Prices very reasonable.",0
"Food is always good but with only half the tables occupied at 1:40 PM none of the empty tables were being cleaned. We, and right now the next 4 groups have had to clean their own tables.",0
"Loved the burgers! good sized meat patty, toasted buns and smothered with extra cheese and bacon. You pay extra for the cheese and bacon but it is well worth it they don't skimp on anything!",0
This is where I am going from now on to get tires. It was fast cheap and the service was good. Plus they have a great deal on covering your tires. Way better than big o tires,0
Friendly service.  The carnitas I ordered were tasty but were dry.  The rest of the food was what we had come to expect from Macayo's. Good salsa and friendly staff.,0
"I think this is a decent venue, unfortunately the times I was there, there was no food and the concerts were very long. It would have been nice if they offered a little something extra besides drinks, but a lot of places don't.",0
Great beer selection and good pizza.  Appetizers leave something to be desired but the good service and live music make it worth coming back.,0
"I always get the carne asada burrito here, it's my favorite.",0
"Poor customer service. Do not hold to their quote. Techs who come out don't know pricing, neither does the office person answering the phone.",0
"Great neighborhood gem! Friendly staff, fresh deli, groceries, produce, smokin deals on liqour and beer.",0
"Have been here twice, and the service and food have both been extremely good. They have a pretty good wine list too here.",0
Wonderful neighborhood Italian spot. Waiter was from Milan. Great evening!,0
When I called I started talking and she said hold and put me on hold about 5 mins later she finally got back on and was very rude.\n\nWill not send people there!!!!,0
Very tasty food from vegetarian perspective.  Loved their home style tofu and egg plant.  Atmosphere was nice. The owner was very friendly.  I'm definitely coming back.,0
"Great, fun atmosphere, and good food! What more could you ask for?!",0
"Great margaritas, but kinda pricy for what they have. Their food isn't all that special :(",0
Pricey. Its a fancy atmosphere with not-so-great food and service. I expected more for my money.,0
"Yuck\n\nTwo stars because the margaritas were tasty.  The food was horrible.\n\nEverything tasted pre-made, pre-packaged, and horrifically commercial.  Yuck!",0
"Consistently slow service, always the bare minimum working. Try not to come in when it's busy.",0
Simply delicious!  Very friendly people making and serving great dishes.  Many larger restaurants with so-called vegetarian/vegan menu sections could learn a lot from this place.,0
Still one of the best places on earth to buy toys and video games.  Their selection is great and usually they have great sales right before major holidays.,0
"Average Chinese-American restaurant. As far as service goes, I live next door and gotta say this store cannot compare to the one in Vegas. The staffs here are not as friendly and enthused.",0
I treat myself to this every once in a while as an indulgence.  Food is fabulous. Best Philly Cheese steak in Arizona.  Always fresh ingredients and they ship in specialty items in from Pennsylvania.,0
They now close at 10pm instead of 11pm. I am taking away another star.,0
This is a wonderful find. The local couple are so nice and the prices reasonable. I highly recommend this place.,0
The gentlemen that work here are very helpful and nice. Get's busy but I guess that's always good for business!,0
"They have a great selection here.  I got a new gym bag for $30 and a sweatshirt for $24.  If you're a huge Nike fan, come here!",0
"Please see my other review for Summerlin Hospital. Again, there are 2 Yelp pages for the same business.  When I checked in I guess it checked into a different one. :)",0
"Arrived and waited for 10 minutes before I grabbed a menu and asked an employee if the guests were supposed to seat themselves.. He responded \""You can\"" and walked by with out furthering assisting me.",0
We took our valet's advice and hit up this local Las Vegas spot. We were served quickly and both enjoyed out delicious omelet's. We will definitely hit it up again next time.,0
"Free, easy access, a paved hiking trail that is 1/3 of a mile long.  Small playground with equipment in good shape.  A perfect place for your toddler!",0
Bring your own ranch! They charge $1.00 for ranch. Food is OK but service SUX. E for effort.,0
Crab was seasoned well with Old Bay.  Moderately overpriced due to the very small portions of sides.,0
KFC has seriously gone down hill.WAYY over priced.will stick with Churchs chicken from now on,0
"I went here to have a battery changed in my watch. It was not cheap, however the freindly service and the quickness of it more than made up for it.",0
"Sunday Brunch was really nice.  Not over the top, but well worth the $13.  Will go again.",0
"The JCC has a great gym. I highly recommend going to Lyn's zumba classes, which are free to all members. She has a strong dance background and she's very energetic and easy to follow.",0
Great food and decent prices.  Much better prices than traditional places like Macayo's and Manuel's.    Usually good service but can be challenged when there are a lot of people.  Great bar as well.,0
"Sold us a pair of expensive Lucchese boots that turned out to be factory defects, stamped on the inside was FD, they did not disclose this. Buyers beware!",0
"I've tried their pasta and, more recently, their pizza, and both were very unremarkable, which has been quite disappointing considering what I had heard from others. The pizza in particular seemed bland and tiresome.",0
"Excellent NY style pizza!!!  The wings are great too!!!  The place is spotless and the manager (Eric) has the place running like a fine-tuned machine.  Not the best area, but worth the trip!!!",0
Waitress (jen) was nice but we waited very long for the food. Food also not too tasty. Ordered the chicken crepes and were cold when they came out.,0
2 stars for a nice staff... but the place is in need of a major cleaning and upgrade.,0
This place is good. The pho is great. It's clean and the service is great. Spring rolls are worth a try too and the ice coffee.,0
thanks fellow yelpers we went to breakfast this morning good food resonable prices i will have to try there burgers before i can give this place a higher rating,0
"Good food, usually very fast, and a convenient location. I definitely recommend if you are looking for fast food",0
"This place is great. Refreshingly different, good atmosphere, well made drinks and reasonable prices.\n\nCouldn't give the full 5 because of the location - it isn't close to anything.",0
"Fun place.  Because it's just typical Mexican food, I can't bump it up beyond 3 stars.",0
"If you want good (even great) food and GOOD service, just walk down the street a block or so to Bandera",0
"Rooms are decent but loud. Internet sucks which is why I won't be back. Not a great place. Service was ok, wireless internet is unreliable.",0
"There is something for everyone, healthy, and tasty. I take my clients here often and end up eating here 2-3 times a week. I can always try something new, and be happy with it.",0
"Friendly staff, plenty of options behind the bar and decent food for the price. I had the \""boxty.\""",0
I am always impressed by the fact that they seem to have everything I need despite their size!  Everyone is friendly and knowledgeable.,0
"The service is terrible, It took at least an hour for my table to get our food after ordering it. Not to mention it is cold inside, and uncomfortable. The food was average.",0
Very friendly salon. I stopped in real quick to get an eyebrow wax and the staff was attentive and genuine. The place is beautifully decorated. I will be returning for a facial.,0
"Went there for Arizona Restaurant week and discovered a gem!    Food was excellent, service great and ambiance charming.  The only negative is that it is located in an area that seems a little run down.",0
amazing italian food and great service. I can't wait to go back.,0
Used to here often when I lived here. A PGH landmark. Ignore the haters. Enjoy it for what it is and you will like it.,0
"Good food, huge servings. Decent service.",0
Pleasant shop.  Good stuff and some junk too. Got great deal on a dress and cute skirt.  Its a treasure hunt.,0
"Their pancakes are awesome with specialty flavors. Their omelet is very weak. If you come for the pancakes you will be very happy, anything else and I think you will be sorely disappointed.",0
"Service was very slow tonight, we got a table right away, but food was not coming out of the kitchen. Drink refills very hard to come by.",0
"Clean, simple, easy and very good sandwiches! A nice other choice for sandwich fare. The salt n vinegar chips are tangy and good! The #12 sandwich very tasty - nice to have alfalfa sprouts for sandwiches!",0
"What a great sports bar. Lots of TVs, great atmosphere, and great food. Try the telluride burger, wings, or foccocia. For dessert the cookie platter is the best.",0
Standard family diner. Nothing surprising here. A decent place to stop for breakfast.,0
"Been looking for good \""hole in the wall\"" Mexican in Charlotte for over a year, glad I finally found this place. The salsa, queso, and chimi are all very good, much better than Azteca!",0
This was the most disturbingly bland meal. Yuck.,0
"A bit dark in the evening. Could use more signage. Customs can take a while, so don't try to cut your flight too close.  Staff is friendly and foods are overpriced. Otherwise, no complaints so far.",0
The art of bread making is alive and well here! Excellence in everything they do! Can't say enough good things about their baked goods!,0
"Excellent food, however,  I wished the corned beef was homemade and not from a can. My friend had the Denver omelet which he says was first rate!",0
"Nice one time visit. For those with kids, there is a water park with little squirting water fountains.",0
Airports are airports. Facility was nice with easy to access information. Restaurants and food stops- average price. Airports are always more expensive.,0
"This store is closing August 16th. Why??? Cause they never remodeled it, poorly run and tired.  This is going to hurt all the other tenants in this shopping center.\nNice work AJ's, glorified food city",0
Awesome food service and atmosphere. We throughly enjoyed our dinning experience and strongly recommend this restaurant to all our friends and family,0
"I love this place! Best menudo in town. They serve it all week but I suspect they make it fresh on the weekends.  Can't beat the price, $5.25 for a good size bowl, satisfies every time!",0
I love the food here. Love the vibe.,0
This is a pretty good Arby's the food is fresh and relatively fast. The best part about this location is the warm and inviting staff.,0
"The service was good, but the food lacked flavor. It wasn't inedible, though. I ordered the French dip with a side of sweet potato fries. The other people in my party seemed to feel the same way about it.",0
"If you want good service, see Nicole at the bar! She was on top of everything and knew how to pour beers!",0
"The food is good but let's be serious, you come for the dessert.  Try the Top Hat.",0
"Every single dish was fantastic and we had a lot of them.  Stuffed mushrooms, roasted asparagus, lobster ravioli, lasagna bolognese, and Dover sole!!  All great!!",0
Took 40mins (and i was next in line) for me to exchange my 2 chargers that I had 2 replace 4months ago.the guy that helped me was to busy checking out women to wait on me,0
Worst customer service ever. The manager is rude and talks bad about the client and little care for his customer,0
"A pretty decent mall, a few too many empty stores of late though.  The food court is okay.  The carousel is real cool looking.",0
the place is nice very hipster food  ok nothing to write home about needs a better beer selction with some more euro stuff,0
This place is consistently wonderful. We had our rehearsal dinner here and it was incredibly well run.,0
Yeah it's old school but the price is right and who cares your going to get ripped on cheap booze anyways at fremont st. Slept like a rock.,0
"Got a 12 Oz prime rib for lunch and flavor wise it was meh it arrived cold needed salt and 1/4 of my steak was just a chunk of fat took a nice photo, not a fan.",0
"I guess if you fly USAirways, maybe this airport is good. Maybe it should be named USAirways Charlotte international.   If you fly out of concourse A, good luck.",0
"Excellent food as usual.  However, 30min wait to get my food on a Friday night while others that came after me with large orders got theirs first!",0
"Not a fan. Pool and courtyard very dated. The \""awesome\"" buffet was more like luke warm cafeteria food. The best part the place is the Grand Cafe who actually served decent food. Prob won't stay here again.",0
"Fantastic seating, not a bad seat in the house.  Plus there's fantastic eats!",0
Delicous Mexican food at a great price! Love the green chili tamales and chicken chimichangas! Endless chips and salsa are delicious as well.,0
Have the chicken avocado burrito. It was great.,0
Typicall bar food.  The golden wing sauce is really good.,0
"A decent steak in a location that is in dire need of an update.  Also, a nice and denser then average creme brulee.",0
"It's inexpensive, but it's really small. I didn't find anything special about it.",0
Don't know what the hype was. The curry was very different. The service was awful.,0
Went here the other night for the first time.  I am glad i experienced it but it was not all that great of food for the price.  Probably will not go back.,0
"i usually get sick from taco hell food but i love their caramel, apple empanadas. they taste like street fair food! so good!\n\ni also like their frozen lemonade-based refreshing drinks...",0
"Yoose wants some good NY pizza?! All's you got is three choices, good pizza, better pizza,  and best pizza! Now get outta here!",0
I love this place. Pasta & Chicken dishes are always good and so are the deserts. I take friends from out of town and they leave loving it!,0
"I went through the drive through at 1:15 am and drove away with my food at 1:50 am, no joke. It would have been faster to park and walk into the Walmart McDonald's.",0
"This Target sucks if you are shopping for clothes, accessories...etc. Good for buying other things but as far as fashions I have to drive to the one on the SW side.",0
I always have great service.   The shuttle is always available to take me to / from different parts downtown.\n\nTake advantage of the shuttle!,0
I have been using Elite Cleaners for over 10 years now.  I love the free pickup and delivery service!  Clothes come out great and I feel their prices are fair.,0
A pick up with many items missing.  Including tortillas for tortillas for fajitas.  Would of been excellent but couldn't drive all the way back for tortillas n sour cream defeats reason we had it pick up,0
"Let's be honest. The salad bar is just ok. They rest of the food is really terrible. So if you like this type of food, your in the right place.",0

Good food. Great prices. Wings made the way God intended. Awesome place!,0
Always love the salad bar! They also have a great California club! Staff is pretty attentive.,0
Bad food and slow service. Chili was Luke warm. Burgers were raw in middle.,0
Great place for dinners for a date/families. Friendly employees great food and delicious cheesecake.,0
Best Pho I have had in my life! This place is so good its popular. They even have  a sign in sheet. That tells you something!!,0
"Just an egg and cheese breakfast burrito, came with random grills scraps.  Just nasty.  Egg tasted like it was cooked with engine oil.",0
I love the atmosphere at the Farm (when it's not too hot) and the food is pretty darn good every time I've gone.  The downsides are it's a little pricy and gets pretty crowded when it's nice out.,0
"The wings were excellent. I had the gourmet works pizza. I wasn't too thrilled with it, but it wasn't nasty. The service was great. And the place is clean. I would go back here!",0
"Went in today and asked for John, my mechanic.  They said he no longer works there.  Wouldn't trust the rest of them to work on my daughter's PowerWheel.",0

"We just moved to Buckeye, (Verrado) and was experience was awesome, Yes its in Downtown Buckeye, not a nice place to say the least, but its worth the experience.",0
"Good entertainment because of the Showroom. Their food is alright and same with the bars. So, not too great, but not too bad neither.",0
A great spot for dinner salads.  I didn't love my Cobb salad but the Asian chicken salad is bigger and tastier.  I found the soup too salty but the samdwhich was great and full of veggies as well.,0
"Opinion.. finely dice your Jalepenos in your cream cheese, too big of slices and it wasnt spicy.",0
best chinese food! people that work here are so nice!,0
I swear I think they tried to poison me my drink was sour and tasted like something rotting the next morning I went to pour the soda down the drain and it reeked of something awful. I can't go back after that.,0
Excellent late night dining menu. Can't wait to go back during their regular hours. Service was great. Steven was our server and did a great job. Great margaritas!! :),0

I love the food here! To dark & to many tvs for my taste but my kids always have something to look at!,0
I stopped coming to this location because they NEVER give you napkins in the drive-thru..employees here are pretty grumpy.,0
I will never go to this place again. The quality of food is very poor and the servis is terrible. I wound not recommend this horrible place.,0
Great place to grab a quick bite before a meeting in the halls of the Government Center. The cajun chicken sandwich is out of this world and the make your own Arnold Palmer is always a great addition. Make sure to check it out!,0
Great service. Very friendly and helpful workers. They got my requests correct and very knowledgeable when I asked questions. My new location.,0
"Shopped at this location and the customer service was awesome, highly recommend this store to my friends.",0
"They are pretty good. Some times you have to really pay attention to make sure they do a good job. I really like Trina or Fawn. They up charge you for using your credit card, which I'm not sure is legal....",0
"food quality a 4, server attitude 2 so averaged at 3. said thank you after drink delivery no response repeated thank you at food delivery still no response, finally spoke when delivering check. Chips and Salsa are a 5!",0
"What a great restaurant! The food was great, the view was magnificent. What more can you say, they lived up to their reputation!!",0
"Wow!...you would think they would want to serve you beer. 20 minutes here, it's dead and we had to fetch our beers.",0
"Assembly of God churches are wrong on salvation. No matter how entertaining the music is, nobody should go there and be deceived by false teaching.",0
This is the nicest place ever. Every old book imaginable. Nice people. Great location.,0
"Very bad purchase experience. I bought a shirt with a hole covered in the rolled up sleeves, but they denied my request to return it. I am so angery at this and will never shop their chothes anymore.",0
"Food is very good, lunch specials affordable, and you can get an extra soup instead of the eggroll, which I prefer.",0
Ok. Average Chinese at best. Was expecting better based on the yelp reviews. Chicken schzwan was mild and bland. Would not likely go back.,0
"There was absolutely nothing not to like.  Reasonably priced wines, home style Italian cooking. Great upbeat ambience.",0
"It's cool because it's a big time dive. The food is ok. The shells are deep fried, but the guts are very boring. Overall it's ok and the prices are ok. It's worth going once...twice max.",0
"JC Penny pricing is very deceiving these days due to rebranding. Bought something and they had 3 different price written over the stack...When scanned, it was the highest price...\n\nAvoid JC Penny until they figure it out",0
I'm not over here very often but I always love dropping by for a late night breakfast or brunch if I can. Super taste diner food ^_^,0
Worse service in town.  Food is average at best.  Prepare to be ignored.,0
"The last time I went, the service was horrid and the waitress was rude. But still, it's a great place to go for breakfast! I'm also a fan of the monte cristo sandwiches they serve.",0
"Fast, friendly, but flavorless. Beef and broccoli was tender but had the flavor of water",0
"Good pretzels, though I am convinced the pretzel \""game\"" is a racket.",0
Cool place for breakfast.  Breakfast burrito was fantastic.,0
"A damn good, real burger!  Totally worth dropping in... great cheeseburger and the generous portion of fries had to be shared among 4 adults!",0
No coffee ready at 5 am? Really. Nothing much else to say.,0
"We had a disappointing experience with customer service regarding a group reservation. In fact, they have yet to call back to confirm or cancel. If they can't get a reservation right, what else would have gone wrong?",0
Ordered delivery food took two hours and was cold. Wing sauce was spilled all over bag.,0
Nice neighborhood hair salon.  Prices are great.  My gal is Kelsey...love her!!!\nEveryone there is nice,0
"Wow. Thursday night and this place was dead. Lights really bright, bartender seemed to be more concerned about where she was going after work, than working. Don't think this place is gonna make it much longer",0
"Got the creamy pesto penne pasta i added some shrimp,  absolutely delicious.",0
"Sorry, but our pizza was cold.  All nine cuts of it.  And the garlic wings didn't taste like garlic.  Maybe it was an off night?",0
"Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere!  3 hours for a \""partial highlight\"" I went running out of the salon with wet hair! Worst experience in a salon ever...",0
Very nice and friendly staff. Great sense of humor even early in the am and after I drove all night. Great job guys.,0
"The car was in great shape. The maintenance light turned on when I got on the road, I was going out of town, so too late to turn around. The prices were expensive as well.",0
Went to this restaurant several times in Lumberton NC. This is the first time I went to the restaurant in Concord NC. Had the oven roasted chicken. Not the best ever but it was pretty good. The kids enjoyed it too.,0
"Nate, the bartender, is hilarious and some great entertainment. The food is delicious to boot!",0
I am positive no one who reviewed this place got water delivery. Worst customer service ever! Every month there was s new issue and no one knows what end is up when you call. Horrible.,0
One of my favorite places for Greek good. Chicken pita sandwich is delicious! I'm in love with the their Greek fries!,0
"Its been a year since my last review, this location is doing as good job as they can but the new menu is falling flat.  Bring the classics back.  Please.",0
"Love church's but the service here is a joke always slow, you would think at noon they would be prepared for lunch. The staff is always very impersonal and act put out to serve you. This location needs some serious help",0
"I have been coming here for 6 years now, and no other place has been able to usurp this bar's place in my mind. Great place to Become a regular. i do the Karaoke Thursday through Sunday.",0
Best pizza ever. I live across town and still go to this place for the pizza. I compare pizza to this pizza nothing compares at all. You get the best pizza for the best price 5 bucks. You can't beat that!,0
I was kinda disappointed.  I think my expectations were too high based on other reviews and now I'm still searching for a go to Chinese place... For now its Dragon Bowl Inn..,0
"Awesome!\n\nGreat experience, tasty treats!\n\nBring cash.",0
"Great service and cute place!  Food was excellent too.  It was raining outside, so it wasn't too busy.  Love the country feeling of the place.  They give you complimentary berry scones, which are yummy!",0
Great bartenders with the best bar food in town. Have never had a bad experience.   Highly recommend.,0
Get in and get out! Dont fall into the wal-mart trap!,0
good small venue to see good bands.  place gets crowded so get there early for a good seat.,0
I'm 6 feet 2 inches and weigh 275 pounds and a whisky drinker. That 190 octane slush with the extra shot had me feeling super nice.,0
"Great neighborhood location, great laid back environment (outdoor seating only), extremely friendly staff, and a deliciously unique menu. We'll be coming here often!",0
It takes a little bit to understand the owner but this is one of my favorite places to eat. Lunch prices are great and u get a lot of food.,0
Tomatoes looked disgusting and why don't they carry ketchup? Isn't this America? I hope this microwaved breakfast griller tastes good...,0
"I've been here a few times and they never disappoint.  The seafood is incredible, service is good and the decor is - colorful!",0
"Disappointed, was really craving a mexican burrito. I ordered a Pollo Asado burrito and what I got was still raw. The chicken was still pink in the middle! I really don't plan on returning ever.",0
"Lennie does a great job with \""shellac\"" nails! It's reasonably priced and the French lasts a long time.",0
I've never had an issue with any department here at Toy R US! They do need to pay their employees more as you just know that is needed!,0
Good food. Kind pricey as they charge for the extras.,0
Not kid friendly food.  Potatoes are not good.  Pastries looked tasty.,0
Food was good. Nice setting. A bit pricey.,0
"Great value for a sit down place. Food was good. Getting into the parking lot was a little tight, but manageable.",0

"Great food, excellent atmosphere. Weird shopping center, but once you've found it, you'll know. Great stuff!",0
Service was really friendly and the food was alright.  Prices were pretty good too... $4 for a mimosa... sweet.\n\nThe best part of the meal?  The free scones.,0
I can make BBQ at home in my slow cooker. If you want good BBQ go to Smokey Jon's not a chain restaurant.,0
"I always think I'm going to love this place, but then when I'm actually there it's just not that great. \n\nGood for groups, though, because the tables turn over pretty fast.",0
Slow service and the people serving food don't seen to be in a hurry at all to help the customers. I guess bad management.,0
I don't know about this place. It seemed like an upscale Bob's Big Boy restaurant. The waitress was aloof. The place flipped me out to say the least. Super weird time in there.,0
Great food.  Plates are smaller but it is worth it.  Taste is good and the atmosphere is relaxing.  A great place for lunch as well.,0
Food was overpriced and not that great. Slow service wouldn't even refill my drink. Interior is dingy and the tables were sticky I would not recommend this place.,0
"The food was good. A bit spicy,. the chips and salsa oh plenty. Salsa a bit warm, but Im a grengo. Price somewhat high. Didn't have a lunch menu? All- in all would try again.",0
"Great place. I prefer the cheese here over Penn Mac any day! Plus, the french feta is to die for!",0
Vegetarian pizza is outstanding!   Also the Italian sausage pasta with penned pasta is so good!  Always have a great experience gere!,0
It was ok. Parts were good. The sea bass was ok the crab cakes were very good.   I still prefer the bone fish grill. They had great service.,0
Leave lots of time if you are using a rental car!  The rental car center is quite far from the airport and you have to wait for the shuttle.  No tram or alternate routes means at least 20 minute process.,0
"It's Costco!  Love coming here for gas, and will be my first stop if the zombie apocalypse comes, =P",0
"I think this is the worst Pei Wei I've been to.  The food was very bland and the whole restaurant was, for a lack of a better word... FILTHY.",0
Cheap lunch buffet. But I don't like India food. Everything seems disgusting. And smelly.,0
The service was very good. The people that work here are polite and work fast. The white peach oolong is a great drink if you want something sweet!,0
Good fun place for kids and adults the slides are super fun there is enough fun for a full day there's a big game room fun fun fun,0
Food and staff are always awesome! Gourmet steak tacos are my favorite!,0
I was really drunk and it was really good!!,0

"On vacation, found this place.  Great food, huge portions.   I'd return any time.",0
"Some seriously tasty pizza.  Felt like I was back in Italy again.  Love that they have pizza marinara listed right on the menu, which is an excellent option for vegan folks!",0
Had this for lunch one day before work - bad move. I was totally useless all afternoon as I felt like I had a brick of acid eating away at my stomach lining.,0
OMG. This is the best BBQ ever. Ole Bill's recipe has no match.  The mac 'n cheese is heaven on earth.,0
Pretty awesome place. Great pools and kid friendly.,0
"Good place to go see a movie, only $7 matinee, not as good of a place to eat. The buffet is lackluster at best, something as simple as bread pudding lacks the flavor you would find in other buffets.",0
"Food was pretty terrible honestly.  I hate to say it because I love hardworking immigrants, but the food and restaurant decor were really bad.  The place even smelled funny.",0
"Reminds me of a place back in Chicago me and my wife would eat at. Looking forward to the happy hour there, as the deals looked pretty good, and the food was excellent. Really liked it.",0
Parkway is down home country goodness with some of the friendliest folk in Charlotte / Concord!,0
Wait was long... service was bad (aside from one bus boy).  Food???  Not worth the price you pay for.,0
tried to travel a day earlier due to the terminal illness of a relative. informed that it would cost $ 400.00 more to due so. leeches!!!!!1,0
Absolutely wonderful!!  Went to AZ for a weekend vacation.  I wanted a nice massage before I jumped on a plane back to California.  The staff was very helpful and the massage was very relaxing!,0
This company was horrible to deal with. We took our vehicle in to be repaired and they continued to call with more work they wanted to do. We had to pay them $600 to get the vehicle back and it still isn't fixed.,0
"I just want to like it due to its location and great beer selection, but the food is awful.",0
I totally disagree Vaqueros is better than Federico's.  The food at Vaqueros is insipid flat and greasy.,0
Carowinds is a fun place.....where else can you spend $4 on a bottle of water?!,0
"I have been using discount tire for 25 years and swear by them.  Service is fast, efficient and they patched 1/2 a dozen tires for me for free.  No one else will ever get my business.",0
This place is always consistent. Salad bar is yummie!,0
"Excellent lunch experience. Fresh creative salads, wonderful sandwiches, excellent & friendly wait staff. Beautiful & yummy desserts. Would definitely return if I were in the area.",0
I've probably eaten here 20 times.  10 times w/ my wife too.  Always good food and eaten a bunch of different things.  Good deal and good service too.  Food will surprise you,0
A delicious menu with a twist. Unique wine list too!,0
Got sick eating at Claim Jumper in the Casino.  Then woke up to beetles in bed with me.  The only cool thing was the pool.,0
"The BORDER burger is delish! Onion rings are fantastic. The cookies, though they look bad, are very good! The service is good too.",0
"This is a weird complaint, but I absolutely hate when I can taste dirty tap water in food. Everything I had from this Taco Bell had a lovely City of Mesa aftertaste.",0
Had the Santa Fe salad (half order) and tomato soup.  Delicious!,0
Not a good experience. At least I got a refund after the issue.,0
"I enjoyed the outdoor seating, but no real food inside for a light eat. But can't complain about the drink prices. Saw a few dead bugs not really my taste.",0
"Nice employees, nice location, Awful sushi.  Should have known something was amiss when it was empty at 6:30 on a Friday night.  Surely there are better places in town.",0

pretty good salon. never had a bad experience there and the stylists are always very friendly. also a great location close to my home. cant ask for much more than that!,0
My wife came in for alterations and was treated quite rudely.  This kind of customer service (or lack thereof) is simply inexcusable for any business establishment.  I advise you to go elsewhere for your tailoring needs.,0
"Great fish tacos.  I always pick at least one grilled option.  If you do 2 fried fish options, then it can be too much.  Pasta salad side is really good too.",0
"You step in to a hip salon,professional,welcoming staff like Katie,and invested stylists like Gigi.",0
"Best airport wifi of any airport I've been to! It's hardly crowded, but the taxi lines can get ridiculous -- they move fairly quickly, though.",0
"It's fast Japanese food and it's done pretty average.  We only went there because it was close and supposedly cheap.  But after we added everything up, the lunch tab was pretty hefty.",0
Watery bloody and slow service. Terrible management.,0
Delicious frozen custard and great outdoor atmosphere! Two spoons up!,0
"If you're flying an airline that flies out of terminal 3 like United, you better give yourself an extra 20-30 minutes. The terminal 3 security line is far far far slower than terminal 1.",0

"I enjoyed the small tour they have, and my daughter thouroughly enjoyed making a chocolate pizza. I am very impressed at the quality of candy. The french mint chocolates were my family's Favorite.",0
"This place was horrible!  The pizza was so bad I had to spit it out... I also ordered the chopped salad, not only was the salad chopped to nothing, the balsamic dressing was not good.",0
I love walmart it has everything. The cashiers never seem happy ever I would be happy I have a job. And the parking lotus always full I still love it though,0
"Truly stellar alteration service. I brought my bridal gown in for alterations: the prices are very reasonable, service is fast and professional--and Darlene is a delight. I will be coming here for all my future alteration needs!",0

The coffee was pretty good. Was nice to see a local micro roastery.,0

"Today, two clerks at the Eastern store insisted that \""Extra Dry\"" champagne was drier than \""Brut.\""   WRONG!!!",0
"Food was good, but halfway through the meal we saw roaches on the walls and floor.  That part was not so good.",0
So much better than Pei Wei right next door. I am a big fan of this place for lunch.,0
The service was okay but geez the place smells like pee.,0
"I ate here about 37 times in a 5 day period 2 years ago and I still wake up crying sometimes because I realize that I live nowhere near Ronald's Donuts.\nYou've ruined my life, Ronalds Donuts!",0
I really do not understand why the reviews are so good.  The food was very mediocre and it smelled like old beer in the restaurant.  I do not recommend this place.,0
"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte! Their \""gringo dip\"" is delicious. I wish they had more than seven or eight vegetarian options- but they're all good. Their spinach and cheese quesadillas are excellent.",0
The burrito platter has a ton of food on it and tastes great. Awesome Hatch Valley Chile too!,0
Food is to spicy for me.  Plus I hate that I have to go in the store to pay for my food if I forgot cash.,0
Great place with prices comparable to online shopping. The staff are more than willing to help even the most inexperienced of brewers.,0
Why have this restaurant listed? IT HAS CLOSED DOWN!!!,0
Coworker found this restaurant on Yelp. The Belgium Waffle was overcooked yet the batter was very tasty. The waitstaff was definitely the most enjoyable part of this restaurant.,0
Great restaurant! It really is nice to look at and the food is great. My friends and I have stopped in just to chat and soak up up the atmosphere over some chips and shirley temples!,0
Love to support downtown area businesses but the ladies attitude who owns the place is caustic.  Too many other choices.,0
"I didn't have much of a view from my room on the club level.  However, the facility was clean and quiet.",0
"Had two pairs of jeans tailored. Great turn around time, great pricing, quality work was okay.",0
Vassie Gardner went way way out of the scope of normal customer service to help me get the part to fix my tire. I have always had great service at Discount tire but this went into another galaxy. THANK YOU Vassie!,0
"Just awful.  How do you screw up  breakfast?  Rubbery bacon, undercooked/raw french toast. Folgers quality level coffee. Will not be back.",0
So dissatisfied we went to Denny's afterwards.  Sour cream and lime extra charge for your tacos?  Not going to eat here again.,0
"A good pub close to Myers Park Country Club. Packed on the weekends with a lot of fratty people, but still a good vibe.",0
Cold soup and noodles for pho ha (Chicken Noodle Soup) plus the egg rolls gave after the payment waiting too long for this food never happen like this before in the past I'm sad and disappointed,0
The food is mostly tasty but way voerpriced for the quality. Try the med grill a few blocks down. Much better.,0
It was abnormally warm inside and the food was sub par at best.  Drinks were also below average.  Not worth the price or time.  I had high expectations for this place and it definitely did not live up.,0
Excellent Food with Great prices and very generous portion sizes. I keep going back here time and time again for lunch. Very busy lunch hour so if you get there towards the end of the noon hour be prepared to have just okay service.,0
We went here as a family.  Music was pretty loud and the food was average at best.  We won't go back again it felt more like a college bar and not a place for families.,0
If you fly US Airways be prepared for a huge line. This Airport/Airline combo doesn't learn or care to learn that they are broken. More machines and a couple more people would help make the baggage/ticket process less painful.,0
Very yummy better than most Korean places back on Oahu     Will visit every time I come back.   Combo plate!!!,0
"I told him no Swiss cheese and they still made it, and they still made it with this was cheese I had to wait a second time I would recommend coming here they don't pay attention.",0

PIZZA EXTREME has RC Cola.\n\nPIZZA EXTREME does not have recycling bins.,0
Everything here was amazing. The service was fantastic! I'm only sorry we didn't make it for Brunch because I'm told it's even better! Can't wait to return.,0

"Free parking, Wednesdays 3-9pm free admission, what a great way to spend an afternoon! I was quite impressed that they have such an impressive and diverse collection.",0
"Small shop that was dimmy lit when we went. Much smaller selection than the Beef Jerky Store and a bit pricier for small items. They did have unique items, but nothing that got my attention.",0

Food was decent-good portions. Maybe the sticky menu just threw me off.,0
"Wide range of vegetarian options. Great chicken tikka masala! Very friendly and attentive staff. If you're into Bollywood, this place plays videos too.",0

love this place. great food with local feel.,0
They are never on time. I will wait an hour after my apt time just to see the vet. Ridiculous.,0
I've been going to this place for years. Best teriyaki chicken and orange chicken bowls I've ever had. I miss Foo. He always made lunch runs fun. Always great service though and not too long of a wait.,0
Easy Movers are the best. I was very skeptical about my movers. But these guys are very professional and extremely hard working. What I admire is how caring they were with our personal possessions and belongings.  Thank you EM.,0

"This is a great way to enjoy a game, it's regular Friday's food and 50% of the face value of each table is credited to the food and beverage total. The table is available about 30 minutes before the game.",0
Bug in my veggie sandwich from the bar :(,0
Love this place. The tour keeps me coming back with over a hundred beers to choose from! Food is not the greatest but the atmosphere is worth it.,0
"Just came across a stash of Rehab drinks! Don't get too excited, i got all they had - 9 cans :D\nNice employees, had whipped cream which I also needed.  This is a good corner store.",0
"Ok, not a bad place at all.  I usually stick to appetizers. The portions  are large and enough  for 2 to share.  Fairly fast service and decent prices.",0
"Store selections are all right. Definitely one of those \""get what you need and get out\"". One of my biggest gripes are the people working the kiosks  are terribly annoying by trying to sell their products.",0
For best location but a bit of slow in service.,0
We were here for their lunch buffet. The chicken tendori? was very tender. Coconut dessert was good. Everything was bit too salty.,0
I refuse to eat at a restaurant where you stole 98% of your menu from another restaurant and just changed the names!  Shame.\n\nWish I could give zero stars,0
Worst service ever they made up a story about getting a new oven in please!!! Make the order lazy asses!!,0
This restaraunt has from line employers who have visible tattoos.  Disgusting.  They do not care about professionalism or cleanliness of the employees.,0
Typical retirement course. The greens were in good shape. Had some challenging holes which was nice. A good value for Phoenix in the middle of winter when golf prices are outragous.,0
"Our go to delivery Japanese restaurant. They're reliable, and give good portions of food. The miso soup is delicious! Chicken Katsu is one of my favorites.",0
Terrible salad as lettuce was wilted a bit.  Steak was so filled with marbleing that it was ineatable.  The cup of water was good.,0
Had the authentic enchiladas and they were very nice and if the weather is nice then plan to eat on the back courtyard,0
This place is no where near mexican food. Everything seems to be out of the freezer or a can. My entire experience at this restaurant was horrible.,0
Pretty average production-like faire. The fried rice is boring and the food is kind if salty. Disappointing.,0
Love their pizza and garlic knots. Super Yummy and fulfilling! Everyone is friendly and the service is fast. I would recommend this spot to anyone looking for a new pizza place.,0
Food is good but dishes are a little high in price.,0
"I like it, I don't love it and I don't have to have it but once in a while its nice to please my sweet tooth.  There are so many different combos of cream you can mix and match.",0
The bottom line is Gold Bar is a local spot with a devoted clientele.  It is chill and comfortable.,0
"Its good cheap mexican food, but it give you diarehha!",0
I love this place and the new owner is very friendly and nice!!! :)\nU won't regret it! The price is good!!! Im going here all the time!!,0

I think that they have the BEST pizza in town!!!! Way better than Pizzeria Bianco!!!!!,0
"Great location in Verona!  The bar is beautiful and they pour a large glass of wine for a good price.  Food is marginal at best, but not consistent.  The only thing I enjoy eating is the cheese bread.",0
We went for a business lunch and were not drinking. It's not a great experience when you're not drinking. :-/,0
Asian Sesame Chicken Salad is my favorite 'healthy' lunch.,0
They gave money to discriminate to gay people.\n\nForget about it.\n\nI will never ever eat there again.\n\nThey are major bigots.,0
The worst delivered pizza every half of it was missing cheese and the slices weren't  even cut properly! Never again,0
Still my favorite pizza place!  The pepperoni and ricotta is so good.  The service is always great.  We dine in and sometimes order it to go and the pizza is always delicious.,0
"eh, overpriced and kind of dirty.  i guess if i lived on campus and didn't have a car i'd think it was pretty great though.",0
"Super friendly staff, and great deals on all sorts of products!",0
"LAME, I came for an internet special and even after showing it to my server did not honor it due to the fact that no manger was available. BAD REVIEWS ARE A BITCH!",0

Had guests from out of state so we visited Four Peaks for lunch on Saturday. None of us were disappointed. I could become a regular here!,0
Was very disappointed with the food. It was overcooked and not seasoned very well,0

This store is all right everyone is being nice to me when I came in but it's kinda messy when I ray some clothes inside the fitting room.,0
"Horrible food,over proced, and the place looks like a dump! Yike! Yike! Yike! Never again",0
The best bruschetta ever.\nSo many delicious  flavor combinations.\nMake a meal of it.\nHighly recommended..,0
As usual food and service is great! Our 16 yr old son could not even finish the eye opener!  The portions are huge and the quality doesn't waiver!  Enjoy!!,0
"Poor service and food is overpriced. The food should taste a lot better for what you pay. Also, it's really hard to get a table.",0
"Aloha would always have earned a 4 for me in the past. But today, we ordered our usual corned beef hash dishes. The cornee beef serving was tiny. I guess they are trying to save money on their food now...",0
thought it was very pricey pricey and not enough bargains...quality stuff at big prices,0
"Had a beef/chicken bowl, it was okay. The meat was a little bit tough but good for strengthening the teeth.",0
"The best bar in the valley to see live music.  The food is good, the drinks are reasonable, and the bands ROCK!",0
Yum yum yum. Hungry for Gyros? This is your place.,0
Rude bartender slow service.   I noticed that the bartenders were serving others and ignoring me.   We had to ask for our check 3 times.  We could have just walked out without paying.,0
Simple menu. Cash only. Chili was particularly tasty. The Swiss burgers were quite good.,0
"This is one of my favorite places to get Pho. It's made well here. Good flavor, not too oily. The egg rolls are delicious.",0

"If it's Friday, it's time for LoLo's",0
"I have lived here for 2 years and I absolutely love it! The staff, apartment and the location is perfect! No matter what I need, the staff always has a solution! I highly recommend choosing this place as your home!",0
Worst business ever award. They never answer the phone. Their.customer service is terrible. The store is disorganized and looks like black Friday is everyday. Go somewhere else if you can.,0
Terrible service! The wait is endless and my order is never correct. This isn't the first time! Terrible service!,0
"This jeweler was voted best of the valley!? I really do not see why. The salespeople are pushy and the selection caters to \""grandma\""",0
"I've been there several times, and I have yet to be disappointed.  Prices are very reasonable, and the food is excellent.  Service is prompt and the banter between the employees is an entertaining bonus.",0
Great food and service! This place is AWESOME!!! Everything was delicious and the atmosphere so fun. I would come back in a heartbeat!,0
Awful drinks. The beer was extremely watered down and the mixed drinks were horrible. Not a place for a group get togethers for lunch before a game.,0
"Corn bread does come with the catfish meal. The last time I dined here, they forgot my  muffin.",0
"One of the best pizzas I have eaten. Soft, crispy, a little burned on top. Absolutely delicious! 10\"" for 8 bucks and 22 oz Coors light for $3.50, what a deal!",0
Friendly neighborhood sushi bar...think Cheers with raw fish and nicer decor.\n\nSolid quality of fish with a nice selection of all the usual suspects.  Also good selection of cooked dishes for the non-raw eaters.,0
Nice and cozy. Conveniently located. Just park and fly. Looking forward to getting some good use out of this place.,0
"Clean, Tidy, and promp with service and hospitality. Getting from gate and gate is efficient especially when you go from the main ones over to the far end for flying out on the much smaller jets.",0
"Been back twice to see Viktoria.  All I have to say is, she is a god!!!  Any waxing needs you desire, see Viktoria.  She truly is amazing  :-)",0
"Love this place, there salad dressing alone is worth the trip. Original crust Hawaiian is my favorite but everything is good.",0
"Are you are really looking at the review for LJS?  Its fried stuff, with extra fried stuff in a cardboard boat.  You will regret eating it 30 minutes after you finish, but it is delicious.",0
"Still an original Kmart with the lunch counter & ICEE machine. Lots of good stuff, a little more limited than walmart butter a much better experience and they have lay away",0
Perfect place to come to for burgers and dogs! Especially if you're from Chicago and miss White Castle ;) they definitely makeup for it with their excellent sliders,0
I went there for a Deaf EXPO. This place is so huge and beautiful. It is in the right location because the bar/restaurants are nearby. The parking garage is across the street. I enjoyed this visit very much.,0
Took about 30 minutes for us to finally order and it took practically another 45-hour for the food which only took us 15-20 minutes to eat. Got our food before our utensils. Long story short: horrendous service.,0
"If you are a tourist, this is not \""authentic\"" az mexican food, but will hit the spot.  We usually get the lunch flauta plate.  Good Deal for A-OK Eats.",0
"Over priced, nothing special. Seattle pho is where it's at.",0
This place is probably the best Mexican food I have ever had! The tortillas are home- made and sooooo good. I usually get a plain bean and chesse burrito and it never gets old.,0
Holy Moly!  Best Cuban sandwich I've ever had!! Thank you bartender Jim for the recommendation.. \n\nNever disappointed at Karsen's..,0
"Came here on a groupon. Had bacon wrapped shrimp. good flavors, but the shrimp was over done. Typical beans and rice. Nothing special. The food did come to the table hot. Nothing really stands out about this place.",0
Pretty chill atmosphere. Service was good. Beer selection is good. Lots of fun games to play and have a good time. Other than one creepster that wouldn't leave our table alone it was a pretty awesome experience.,0
A service was alittle clogged for lunch but delish! Side of Fruits were warm but main plate was great.,0
Next time you order a drink and it comes in a glass.  Ask to have it put in a Styrofoam cup. A cocktail waitress brought me a drink with lipstick still on the glass {gross}.,0
I will definitely come back to this place when am craving for good pad thai. I have to say so far the best in phoenix.,0
"Even with a relatively short layover, I was able to make my connection without using moving sidewalks or transporters. It was exhausting, but it was possible. \nBig, crowded and bustling. But pretty well-run.",0
"A great place to find the gift for the hard to buy for person. I could also find lots of thing for the not so hard to buy for, myself!!! Great staff and wonderful place to shop!",0
"I was so looking forward to going to this restaurant.  It has a nice view of a man-made pond, but the food is barely average.  If the ambience wasn't so nice, it would get only 2 stars.",0
"$20 for a personal pizza with cherry tomatoes, and \""some\"" smoked Gouda. \n\nNo salad. No meat. \nNo dice. \nBetter deals and better food at a mall food court.",0
"Great food!!!!!! Ate here for dimsum, the chicken feet are soo good, so delicious. the sauce is very good and they also have other varieties of food as well. will definitely come back again for dimsum",0
It's a nice small zoo. The kids enjoyed feeding the manta rays. 99% of the concession stands were closed and it was really hot out,0
There is a consistent bad smell in the meats/cheese area. The rancid smell is obvious and they lack proper ventilation. Can management do everything about it?,0
"I had the blackened salmon, collard greens and yams. The collard greens were cooked  perfectly and the yams were delicious. Blackened salmon was a little overlooked and under seasoned.",0
Everything was delicious. We had the 25 wing sampler platter and could only eat 18 because the wings were so big. Waitress was nice and very helpful. Would recommend for wings over all others.,0
Very clean and very good quality of produce and meat. Staff is very helpful and great. Well lit parking lot and has security. Prices are high but are ok with vons card. Very efficient and has a nice Starbucks.,0
"So so so damn good, I can't wait to go back for more! The location is in a residential neighborhood which is a little weird but like I said the food is so damn good you don't care about the location.",0
Love this place for it's wine list and great appetizers. I've been twice and recommend going just after it opens up for the evening for quite conversation and,0
Honest folks. Highly recommend. Been here a few times and they always provide quality service. No need to shop around.,0
There were zero other people here aside from my friend and I.,0
Horrible service and ignored several times by the server.  Food was prepared wrong. Cold queso.. should have went to Chili's,0
Indi was awesome! She was very helpful & went out of her way to make sure we were taken care of.,0
"Very friendly service at the drive thru!! 48 degrees out side, I'm ordering a large chili!",0
Staff always friendly.  Food is good and will always be a customer.  Happy hours are excellent.,0
"Their food is ok.  I would not call it special or extraordinary, but it is not bad.  The service is less than desirable.",0
3.5 stars. Not bad but not great. Always have to judge a Mexican restaurant by there salsa and enchiladas.. Both were meh+,0
So the coffee is good but the staff is incredibly loud and screaming does not make for a relaxing atmosphere at all.,0
We love this McDonalds. They are clean and fast and the food is always fresh. The help is polite and i love the sweet tea.,0
"Always a great stop for lunch and or dinner, eat here at least 3 times a week. Excellent food and great service.",0
Food was ok. Air conditioning not strong.  Our dinner guest was a roach crawling on the chair next to me. Felt like being in Mexico.,0
Great european style boutique hotel.  You can not beat this hotel for the money!,0
"I love this theater because they're always consistent. The staff are friendly, the lines are short, and the theaters are rarely crowded (which is great if you love to midnight movies). It is always clean, too.",0
"As others noted the place has a cool touristy atmosphere. That IS its only redeeming quality. The food was sub-Denny's, the service was just OK; we left after our dinner to go out for dinner somewhere else.",0
"Although the people are great with customer, i believe the Cheba Hut on southern has better sandwiches.",0
"Gross. Gross. Gross. Pass this place. Service is awful and the food was just as bad. Greasy, low quality slop.",0
"Nice enough furniture. Salesmen pretty friendly. Not the highest end furniture but as the saying goes, \""you get what you pay for\"".",0
This is a great Subway. The people who work here are so nice and fast and the food is always fresh.,0
My daughter chose this restaurant for her birthday dinner. We were very pleased with the experience. The waiter was helpful and efficient. I find it overpriced so I would save this place for special occasions only. Or when someone else is paying.,0
"Overall a very good Chinese restaurant.  The Orange chicken, Beef broccoli and Triple delight a very good.  The Teriyaki chicken was just ok and the egg roll was good, but not great. Very reasonably priced very good food.",0
"Solid mcdonalds, good coffee, fresh, accurate orders. Free wifi and a remodeled dining room.",0
"I've ordered twice from this location recently at different times of day, and not only was the estimated delivery time unusually long, but my pizza arrived nearly 30 minutes late both times.\n\nThe pizza itself was ok.",0
"Not enough employees at this location. Had to wait 30,min for an employee to assist me in the fabric department, if Hobby Lobby was open on Sundays I would have went there. Not my normal location.",0
"I was looking all around for dvd repair service for my xbox games, but couldn't find any shops for that around.  These guys will repair your disc like new for $3.  \nThanks",0
"okay so the veal was \""good\"", but to advertise as good for kids and not have booster or high chairs is a stretch to say the least.",0
"Very nice location with really nice employees and very good, fresh produce.  You can't beat the weekly deals and the gluten free selection is quite wonderful.  I can shop gluten free and vegetarian for my daughter with ease here.",0
"The service was good, but the food was terrible. I prefer healthy green vegan food rather than soy protein product and meat substitutes. The atmosphere is WEIRD! I'll never go back here.",0
"Healthy and satisfying. I had a rice bowl with \""chicken\"". It had tons of flavor. Also tried the BBQ sandwich was was yummy too. Great place",0
No where near NYC's Little Italy but consistently very good fare for a chain establishment. Great service better than anything in Flagstaff.,0
we call to check on buffet waiting line on valentine's evening and the hostess was very rude and nasty. if u are working and hate ur job get another one.,0
Great family care physicians.  New offices too!,0
I had a bad experience here. The 2 women behind the counter were very rude and kept rolling their eyes at me. I was very offended. I will be taking my business somewhere else next time. so disappointing.,0
"Kids area filthy, fries incredibly salty, tables dirty. Love this food chain, but go to another franchise location. Go to StoneCrest or another to get a much better experience.",0
More of a tourist attraction.  Food is better elsewhere for the cost.,0
Everything about this hotel was top notch! The service truly was outstanding and there to please any way possible. Thank you for [providing everyone of our requests and making our stay very memorable,0
"Another great Mexican spot in Arizona.  Does it ever get bad here??  Love this place, read many great reviews and finally stopped by and had a wonderful, flavorful meal.",0
"Place is the best pizza in arizona, there so nice there too. If ur getting dominos ur an idiot, use the coupon and get a real pizza",0
This would be the chinese hang out. The food quality and price are the reasonable but the service is so- so.,0
"Coming from NY to have a nice pizza joint close to your house is great.  Good pizza with real NY attitude, sort of breaks up all the politeness.",0
"Really, really cute but way overpriced. Love the clothes though.",0
The Razzleberry Pie was super but pricy $12.99. I guess next month is $5.99 pies. Oh well it was yummy.,0
Nice comfortable hotel.  No coffee available from 24-hour room service.  Musty smell in room 606.   Great patio.  Good but expensive breakfast buffet.,0
"Greasy, flavorless and unappealing. I will not go back here and recommend that you too find an alternate lunch stop.",0
"Please remove this restaurant, its been closed for months.",0
Positive: a much younger crowd than the 24 closest to my home. Better people watching. \n\nNegative: crowded,0
Really good deep fried fish that is breaded on the spot. Tastes fresh. Potato salad is very good.,0
"Food, service & ambiance is never a disappointment. Is a little pricey but you get EXACTLY every pennies worth. I always look forward to the different menu items and the smiling faces.",0
The staff was very impolite. Everythin is over priced. I would try the places in Marketplace before ever coming here.,0
The front desk is rude. My appointment time was not honored and they expected me to wait over an hour. I can't say enough bad things about this doctors office. And it looks like you'll catch something in the waiting room.,0
"Came for pie and coffee with my lady! The pie was excellent, the coffee was hot, and the server, Isaiah was superb!",0
"Stayed here for a football game at University of Phoenix Stadium. It's about 10mins drive. Rooms are average, fine for an overnight stay. But great service and very good breakfast... bacon and biscuits and gravy! Yum.",0
"Definitely a great little spot for lunch or dinner. The appetizers, some of them, are big enough to have as a meal.",0
Good beer good food love this location. Baja sauce is awesome,0
"Consulted him for setting up an estate plan.  First meeting was free, and he was informative.  We haven't made our decision yet, but he is definitely worth interviewing for the assignment.",0
It's an airport.  It's ok.  Nothing special.  It's not bad but it gets me to and form where I need to go!,0
Amazing bakery and deli.  Eastern european cuisine.  Friendly and generous owners.  Highly recommend!,0
Always one of my favorite sushi places. Have been coming here for 6 years and have never had any issues with service or the fish. Getting the fish can take awhile but we pass the time playing with our daughter and drinking bombers.,0
Best pizza and food around true mom and pop pizzeria. Very good can not say enough how good it really is.,0
"Great shop. Immediately recognized that another Tempe bike shop had installed wrong size tire, and explained the problem well, then replaced it perfectly. Nice people. Highly recommended.",0

"Amazing food, just loud and always packed. I would definitely recommend the food though! Yummy",0
Food was good.. A little disappointed in my Berry Sangria.. Wish it looked and tasted as good as the picture. Nothing stood out to me tho. I might go back for their cheese sticks tho:),0
2 stars only because the service was good.  Food sucked.,0
Love this place. eat here at least once a month. I always order the lavosh shawarma & chicken del sol. enough said,0
Best brewery I've been to in the United States! I like the fact that there was a wide variety of beer. Something for everybody. But it was also some of the best beer,0
Very good food. Great variety of Greek and Meditteranean dishes to choose from. The Gyros are amazing and I LOVE the meat lovers platter. I highly recommend this place. You won't regret it.,0

"normally the food and service are great, but Sunday the food and service was cold - what's up with this?",0
"The place is a ripoff. Two eggs, sausage, hash browns for 12.70. In Vegas, off the strip, REALLY.",0
"Big greasy delicious slices, it was one of the best pizzas I've ever had",0
Always full when I walk in but they are working fast to service people.,0
"Great pizza, great service. New style pizza and wings. Crust is nice and crispy. Closest to New York you will get. A+",0
The pizza here is good after a drunken night out in old town. It's just a bit greasy.,0
"I like playing here, I normally do well. Folks there are always nice, clubhouse a little older but the course is in good shape. Plenty of challenges on the course make for interesting day if you're not careful.",0
"I have had two bad experiences. Call me stupid, but I'm trying one last time to support a local business. We'll see how it turns out. Check back. No disasters from last visit, but I'm not going back.",0
"Not a very modern decor - could use an update! The food was good, the portions large and the price was reasonable. I recommend it.",0
"If your looking for bar food, that is what you will get. Average price, average food.",0
Always good service and pretty decent cost. The guys working there seem honest and won't force a repair on you if you don't really need one.,0
Nothing special. The Mekong Palace still better but this is my second dim sum. Still looking..,0
What an incompetent group of people. How hard is it to correct a last name and an address I've never even lived at???,0
"I got the chicken and veg bowl. It was so bad that I threw most of it away. It's drenched in sugary sauce, and the chicken still has tendons and fat on it. Not great al all.",0
I've been pricing out tires for quite awhile and fletchers was the cheapest by about $400 including installation.  Ordered the tires Friday morning and by Saturday afternoon I already had them installed. Awesome place!,0
"This place is a total dive...it was messy and disorganized. Most of the party items were cheap and poor quality and the staff when we visited, were hardly helpful and didn't seem to want to be bothered. Spend your money elsewhere.",0
This place is not clean!  Had my nails done there yesterday but noticed that the nail stations and towels were dirty.  My nails look good but if I get fungus I will sue.  I won't be back.,0
"This is just an okay airport - the layout is not great, although I do have to give props to them for easy car rental terminals.",0
"So worth a visit! We visited on Saturday and they had a groups singing, dancing and playing music, as well as various live demonstrations and vendors. Although my favoriate aspect was the juxtaposition of the ancient ruins against the modern Phoenix skyline.",0
"Have been here a few times and there was one staff who was really rude. Girl, if you can't have better customer service, you may only be a barista for your whole life. Guess I'll not go back there again.",0
Went for the midnight and it was so cool! Lot of people lot of girls lot of drink and lot of good time with friends. Will go again,0
Staff are friendly. Sushi is not overpriced although the rolls could be made better. Otherwise this is a decent sushi place for a lunch once in a while.,0
"This place was horrible!  Thw waitress was very nice, however it took 40 minutes to get our soup and grilled cheese.  When we got the soup.....of course it was cold and it was not good at all!",0
Customer service is lacking and parking limited but to be expected in the Strip... Irish creme hot chocolate was surprisingly tasty,0
"This is a pretty decent burger.  I've definitely had better, but overall a solid choice if you're craving a burger and want to pass on a fast food burger chain.",0
"This place has excellent pastries, easily as good as anything you will get from similar places in Los Angeles.",0
"The food is great, and the portions of gyro meat are very generous.",0
"Good place for drinking or seeing a band play.\n\nFood is decent, taps are great, staff is pleasant.\n\nAwful karaoke though. AAA entertainment I think it was, no bueno.",0
Coffee is bland. The hipster baristas are rude. No where to chain up your bike. They close way too early.,0
The Capastrami was awesome! One of the best subs that I have had in a long time. Very nice staff and clean restaurant. Very fulfilling.,0
I would have to say its was mediocre.  Not bad but pretty typical Main stream mexican food. I would still recommend you give it a try. I did enjoy the Potatoes and a nice Cerveza Rita.,0
nice products but just can't afford their prices so I don't shop there anymore.,0
"Just talking to the owner is worth the trip, he's amazing!  And his food is pretty good too.",0
"2 stars for good prices & a nice manager.. But expect cold wedges (fries) and loud, ghetto females at this location who laugh at every person as their walking out",0
Amazing food. My hubby loves the chicken kabob here. Must visit place. But the serving dish quantity changes everytime we visit there. Its not consistency.,0
This Starbucks is teeny-tiny!\n\nSeating inside is VERY limited.  This is a Starbucks to grab and go and continue your shopping at the Waterfront.\n\nBaristas are friendly and fast.,0
"In my opinion the pizza here is better than Aiello's, but the staff is impersonal. Take the awesome people at Aiello's & combine with this pizza & it's a home run.",0
Best dry cleaners in Scottsdale. Ask for Mike at the drive through. Tell him Stew sent you.,0
Foods great..service slow perhaps just a bad day will try again,0
"Great food and nice servers, but extremely slow! It is slow every time, but we come back for the food, it's great!",0
Decent. Low key. Minimal attitude from patrons and staff.,0
One of the worst for placing orders to go they never answer there phone and when they do they never get the order right!! Warning don't call a order in!!!,0
"Classic Tempe location should not be confused with quality food. Bad chips, chicken cheese crisp was mostly salt, guacamole tasteless, and did I mention too much salt. Service however was great!",0
Love shopping at Macy's with the coupons they send me. I can use them for on sale items and I always get a great deal.,0
Pittsburgh Restoration Hardware has the worst customer service..stay away.,0
Cute place for kids but overly priced. $20 for my 5 year old boy to get a buzz cut. Not worth it to sit in a taxi.,0
I have been here before and I liked it. Not impressed this time. I ordered Chicken Benito. It was not prepared as explained in the menu and chicken overcooked. Nothing is worse than overcooked chicken.,0
What isn't to love about Thomas Street? They have the best patio ever out back. The food is really good actually. But I love going there for the awesome drink specials and corn hole.,0
Not a bad place to catch a movie. $5 Mondays are great. Wish they took AmEx,0

"I usually just get take out from here, but we like the fact that they have vegetarian and seafood options.",0
While the desk guy Peter in Santa Barbara was amazingly helpful the rest of the experience sucked. Flights late on the way in. Flight canceled on the way out and I had to find my own way to a different airport to get home.,0
"Food was OK prices were outrageous combination plates are an average 10 dollars, if you want cheese tack on more money. Been there done that won't return......",0
Pretty good homemade bread products.  We stopped by for lunch and had the chicken salad which was decent.,0
Donuts were great.. Staff was surprised that I didn't want coffee. The brownie batter was soo good.,0
It id usually on point but my burrito today wasnt hot.just meat cheese the cheese is still cold.not a good experience probably wont come back for awhile if ever,0

Went there to meet a friend.  Didn't think I'd make a friend in Gaetano.  Reminds me of my father; but with cooking skills.\n\nBest food off of the strip!,0
Cheap Taco's and food. The walls are polka dots. The food isn't half bad for what you pay Service isn't stellar normally I'm reminding them what comes with the meal and to make sure I get what I ordered.,0
Mmm one of my favorite places to go! I love almost everything on their menu and it is all very affordable :),0
Probably a great school for the right student/faculty members. It just was not for me.,0

"Hidden gem of C-U. Free parking in parking garage next door.\n\nBurgers, Beer, Fries. Top 5 burgers.",0

"Generous portions and ample vegetarian choices made this spot a great place to celebrate a friend's birthday.  The service was good, the food came out very quickly, and the price was just about right.",0
I can't wait for the day I walk away from a $120/person steak dinner feeling like I got what I paid for.  This wasn't it.,0
I hate it when I call a store and can't get a live person on the line or anyone to pick up the phone once I've been transferred--which was the case with the plumbing department at this location. You suck.,0
"$5.99 gyro meal is amazing. The gyros are stuffed with delicious meat. I would prefer a little more tzatziki sauce, but thats just personal preference.",0
"i love monicals.\nalways good to have some \""hometown taste\"" when visiting.\ni was told it has changed a bit, but to me it was still as yummy as before.",0
Great menu. Delicious food. Some of the best sunsets in the world out on the patio.,0

"I like this place. It's a fun atmosphere, the bartender is really friendly and fun. The shots 'banana cum suckers' are soooo good.",0
"This is going to sound so random, but I so love the complimentary Ginger Bread muffin they offer in the salad bar. I've yet to have it anywhere else.",0
"Food was great. Drink was questionable. Service was truly sad. I'll try it again, because I've got a $25 certificate, and the food really was that good. I'll report again after that.",0
"The food here isn't great but it isn't bad either. It's cheap but Champaign has lots of great Chinese options such as Lai Lai Wok or Golden Harbor nearby. Among the cheaper options though, this is about par.",0
Mexican pizza tasted like chemicals. The beef in the burritos were awful tasting. Pretty much everything we ordered was terrible. Don't even stop here.,0
Turkey dish I ordered was on the salty side and really nothing to write home about. I won't be back.,0
Might not be best area but the food and drinks were great. Friendly staff! If you go save room for fried ice cream. Delicious. Definitely going back.,0
Really bad & slow service. Will not return.,0
Worst planned parenthood. No one go here.,0
"Service was just ok, food was good but a little too pricey.  They were really slow to get us food and check.  Would not go back.",0
I like this place! I always get my nails done by Mr. Du himself. He is the best. Talkative and sweet and he does a really good job.,0
By far one of my top 5 places to eat in the Phoenix metro area. The burgers are very good. But the best is the beer bread sandwiches. Paired with the beer battered fries. Man-o-man.,0
"Food was ok, way too loud music and people, obnoxious drunk people  but the bartender was nice. However wont be back.",0
"I love shopping here. The staff is really nice, no attitudes. Even the other shoppers are kind. It's always nice. Thanks to everyone for making Whole Foods a nice shopping experience.",0
Everything was GREAT!!!\nI love the origional recipe fried chicken and biscuits!,0
"We have had a very positive experience with Roland; more specifically with Kurt. We needed some special attention to our lease situation and Kurt was extremely fair and helpful. In fact, we will be renting from them next year.",0
The service fees are ridiculous. I split paying their bill into two months because it was so high and they kept calling me. I don't know if their insolvent but their customer service is atrocious,0
Thieves. They want $6 per check even though the check is from a Bank of America account. Can't stand Bank of America. The dick everyone around.,0
Great Response and attention to Detail. I'm grateful for people that care and want to be here. Great Staff. Thank You.,0
"Got info on the tortillas, they are full of lard and trans fat. So for anyone concerned with living with a healthy heart, please be warned.\n\nStill love the salsa! :)",0
Not bad for a quick lunch before work.  I had the ribs and they were good! Which is more than I can say for the BBQ restaurants I have eaten at here in Las Vegas,0
"Great place for a business lunch or lunch with friends.  Had a fabulous sandwich, grilled ham and brie, and roasted green bean salad.  Nice, clean, friendly atmosphere!",0
"Very patient and nice. Some of their jewelry is affordable for the common person. I bought my girlfriend a necklace, a ring, and earrings there. Each time, I had great customer service.",0
Get the daily pasta special.. Can't beat it. Skip salad and dessert-won't have room,0
For Taiwanese style of breakfast.  The  seasamebaked bun is as hard as a stone.  Disappointed!,0
Great staff and always the best haircut. Michael the owner is one of the best in the business.,0
Accepts student I'd's! 7 dollars instead of 10:),0
Just your average sports bar. My girlfriend enjoyed the thin crust pizza so that was good enough for me. Pretty large venue with plenty of seating. Friendly service. Very college-like.,0
Great food...worth the drive.  Chicken and humus is very good and the lamb is some of the best I've had.,0
Went to Morning Glory and had their french toast with candied pecans. It was delicious! Loved being outside and enjoyed the atmosphere so much.,0
"Their cheese quesadilla is to die for! Yumm, can't wait to go back again.\nGreat atmosphere and service",0
"The best part is that the workers are great, and it was sort of interesting.",0
Hi I tried their spicy cat fish and their red curry its really yummy. I go to Bangkok Orchid to try different menu everything i tried is really very good taste. I want people to come by and also try their food.,0
Once a year I look forward to my lunch at this wonderful little place. Thank you for such delicious and nutritious food.,0
My first golfing experience. Was doing pretty well until i got stung by bees on the 7 hole. i spend the rest of the time picking out the bee stings. Good driving range. b,0
"This is a must see and must return with guests cruise-  especially those guests who say \""but there is no lakes in AZ!\""  Beautiful Nature Cruise with 5 big horn sheep, eagles, ducks and more- enjoy!",0
Traffic Jam!!! GET IN MY FACE!!! Sooooooooooooooooo GOOD!! I'm a big SAMMICH FAN!! This IS the place.,0
"Love this place. Great atmosphere, service and good. An amazing value as well! My wife and I love to stop here on a date night for a late dinner. I don't think we have ever had a bad experience.",0
love this place! always fast and good service and great food,0
"Burgers good, not wonderful, sauce is nice. fries are fair (5 guys are better). The custard is well worth it! hard to find a place ot sit. if nice get to go eat at park.",0
Been there many times and loved it every time. I tried many things from the menu and they are amazing especially for the spicy food lovers.\nPrices are reasonable but the lunch porsions can be a little bigger.,0
Gotta agree fully with Mike on this one. They're pushing Obama so hard that we may as well give the presidential election to McCain. \n\nMaybe it's time to move to Canada...,0
"Always excellent, down home style cooking. Never disappoints. Breakfasts are especially great",0
The pizza was good but it is so dirty and all of the tables are shaky.  Terrible atmosphere.  I like a dive if it has character- this place is just gross.,0
closed?  Sign on the door says the landlord seized everything.,0
I refuse to be treated like a criminal by default. I WILL NOT give up my personal property becaue they think I might steal something. \n\nMost of the stuff in this place is junk.,0
I love this place!  So not a fan of their pizza but they have the best salads and awesome iced tea. Love sitting outside here. Great lunch spot!!  Great for take out. Oregano's is yummy.,0
"Do not even think  about it. After seeing tv ads decided to try the chicken. Wrong, dry, old but the staff was having was having a great  time, quality was not a concern.",0
"Slow service! Didnt really feel like I was a valued guest. I think I would feel better spending my money somewhere else, like the Dennys across the street. Then the waitress double charged our cards.",0
"Holy shit this place is hilarious. The food is overpriced, the portions are tiny, and the taste is too salty. The only upside is that the food came out pretty fast but only 3 parties were here. Don't come here",0
The worst place to rent a car from!! They have no cars. Must wait almost 2 hours for a car and they don't care! Stay away,0
"Me and the wife stayed a night, the room was nice and appeared to be clean, \nhowever my wife woke up with Three BED BUG BITES on her leg!",0
Over priced is what comes to mind when I think of this place. No discounts for students & popcorn was stale! I live about 5 minutes away and still will travel the extra 20 minutes to Harkins!,0
"Excellent beer selection, delicious deli, enjoyable people watching- what more can someone want?",0
Awesome! Honest and fair. Will do business again. I came from Gene's Auto Worx in Tempe.  Gene's is shady..,0
Just like any place you always have to check back to see what is new. I would say that a place called A Second Look is much better on 32nd Street and Shea.,0
"**Update: Catherine, one of the owners, sent me a very sweet message thanking me for the business and wishing me a happy holiday. You can't put a price on such good nature!",0
"Love this place! I still kinda like the one on Central slightly better, but this has a cool inside/outside vibe and being next to LGO is awwesome!",0
"Missing NY style Italian food, must come to this place. Great italian food, nice staff, reasonable prices and the desserts are great too. Will be coming back for more. This place is a must for good italian food and desserts.",0
Took visitors on the Just Ducky tour.  Really nice experience.  I grew up in Pittsburgh and learned so much.  Tour guides are lots of fun!,0
"This is the best little cafe. My husband and I go often on the weekends. The breakfast is delicious, and they have very reasonable prices. They have a board with daily specials that rotate. Nothing fancy, just good food.",0
"Frankly, it's okay if you aren't particular. A little too crowded, a little too greasy. If you want pancakes for breakfast and don't want to make them or go to IHOP, you could do worse.",0
"I come in here every so often to make deposits for family member.  The folks there have been very friendly and I have not had any problems.  So, all is good so far...",0
Great atmosphere to hang out the back patio.   Inside is what you would expect to find in any other bar.,0
I went in for medication to help eliminate my pimples/acne. The PA gave me some samples but I was not seen by the doctor at all.,0
It was fine.  Most anything tastes good in butter.,0
Decent airport with a limited variety of food choices and a strange layout. It feels a little outdated but I was only at the airport for a quick layover.,0
Seriously? Shut up. This place blows. Wouldn't last 4 minutes in NY. I'll bet the Vegas store doesn't last either.  This place insults the pizza.,0
Hey do such great work here. Have been here for all my auto body repairs. They are honest and hard working. Recommended by many insurance companies too. Check them out if you ever need them.,0
"Consigned some items, got a check and picked up what didn't sell.  Easy!",0
This is the best place in Pittsburgh to get your haircut with the best price. Bob is very thorough  and an all around nice guy,0
Best morning burrito on this side of town.\n\nLove getting the burrito with some chips and salsa. \n\nLarge horchata please!! Yumm yumm always go here late night. Open 24hr,0
Be careful when you buy things in the store. I've picked up a few items that were expired.,0
I used to love going to AppleBees but the last 3 times it's been a bit disappointing. Food quality is not the same. The only thing that seams to stay consistent is my favorite triple chocolate meltdown.,0
Please be careful here... They scratched my car and I thought the interior cleaning was poor. They seem to rush the car wash process. I'd look somewhere else.,0
"I like the galleria, especially the grand foyer that makes walking into the office like a presidential entrance. \n\nThe facilities are well kept, and everyone who works the center is really friendly.",0
I just called for a quote to clean windows and base boards. The lady who I spoke with was hard to talk to and then hung up when I decided not to go with them.,0
"They got $1.49 breakfast. Eggs, sausage, hash browns and toast. Can't beat that. The only bad thing..the cigarette smoke.",0
Went in to buy a reflective ankle strap and they were very helpful. They took the time to explain everything about strap including how they made them using old tubes from the store.,0
Their broth is pretty good here. Taste really fresh,0
"today I went there for dinner.\nboy, the quality drop significantly. the fish was bad. the rice was bad. after all this time, :(I guess its time to start looking for new sushi place.",0
"What a wonderful little shop! The service is fantastic and the owner is so friendly. Try the ranchero breakfast sandwich, it's super tasty!",0
If you sign up for their rewards program you will get $$ back and 20% off coupon for ALL your shopping on special days so it's a pretty good deal.  This store is well stocked and clean.,0
"I ordered from these guys the night I moved into my house last year and have tried to make it a weekly affair since. Great pizza, pepperoni rolls, and quick delivery. Thanks!",0
The kids the have working at this location don't give a shit about you or your food screw this place. One of them looked all tweeked out. No go!,0
"The only place we will take our cars. Honesty at a car repair place is hard to find, but we found it. These guys are the best!",0
"I had a first time appointment with Mark today. Great haircut, the best I've had in years. He really listened to me and spent a lot of time ensuring that my cut was perfect.",0
It's Rubio's. 'Nuff said.,0
Favorite Pho ever!  I love this place!  The iced tea is amazing!  The service was great too!  I highly recommend it!,0
"Although I completely failed at finishing the Big Unit 22\"" hotdog, I enjoyed eating at this restaurant. Fun atmosphere, and good service. This a fun place to grab a drink and/or late lunch before catching a Dbacks game.",0
Nothing stands out at this pub eatery. I went there for a chamber lunch twice and both times the meals was subpar and very small portions.,0
"The grouper stuffed with crab, and scallops and green beans was delicious! The staff was all very friendly.  Cozy atmosphere.  Would definitely return.",0
"Love the macaroni potato salad and kahlua pork, last time I was here the teriyaki beef was a bit dry.",0
The beer selection is unbelievable and the prices aren't terrible as they are a little lower than some of the other Sharp Edge locations. Try the pizza for a solid yet inexpensive meal.,0
Walked in last night hoping to have a nice pie and great beer but they took off Four Peaks Kilt Lifter.  I quickly went elsewhere.  Why do they replace such a good selling staple?,0
Waiter was friendly but the other reviews here seem to hit the nail on the head.  This place has great potential but the food is bland and overpriced for the quality. Was forced into coming since some family had set up a reservation.,0
"The steaks are tender but they are so soaked in butter that I felt I was eating a movie popcorn bucket.   Thes service was great, but the food just average.",0
Decent place and people but a little run down.,0
"we got food poisoning here - egg drop soup.  in addition to being contaminated, the food was poorly prepared and tasted terrible.  i am amazed that some people reviewed this place favorably.",0
"Great food, large coffee selection, and the best environment. This is the type of I would become a regular at.",0
"Love their Pizza Nortena. That's the only thing I get because I feel like I am depriving myself if I don't. If you have never tried it, TRY IT!!!",0
Not a bad place but it seems small and very limited on what they carry. The store is neat and clean but there is just lack of choices.,0
"This is a lovely resort, but more of an effort should be made to rid the lobby bar of flies...The spa is AMAZING!",0
"Horrible, bad don't eat here. Staff doesn't care about service or quality of food",0
"This is the Pizza place i have searched for all my life, The new york style pizza just melts in your mouth. The perfect crust has been created at enzo's.\nyou must go here period..",0
I was with a very large group that they handled very well.  Each most of us ordered one of the specials and all were great with freshly made pasta.  Excellent service.,0
My husband and I went to Crazy Jim's this week based on the other reviews. All I can say is that we were crazy for going.  We will not return. The only thing that was good were the pitas.,0
Extremely helpful staff that knows exactly what shoes are comfortable yet stylish. The shoes I bought were high quality and durable. I was extremely impressed by the staff.,0
"It's a Burger King like any other.  I prefer their reheated \""flame broiled\"" burgers over McD's.  It's serves it's purpose and it's on our way from Big League Dreams to the US60.",0
This place has great fresh cooked and made mexican food.  Out of all the mexican places in Arizona (which are alot but awful) I will go back here,0
"Sandwich Heaven! Believe the hype. This place is fantastic.\nGets packed at Lunch, but worth the wait. I always get the Super Sicilian. Y U M M Y!",0
"The only nice thing is the patio. Staff unfriendly, food terrible. Probably the worst Mexican food I have ever had. Maybe if we had been drinking it would have tasted better.",0
"Eh. I know it's only fast food, but how many idiots are working in the kitchen? I wish there was a closer one so I could go there in the hopes that they'd get our order correct!",0
"This place needs to be on The Food Network show, \""Restaurant: IMPOSSIBLE\""... I need to remind myself not to eat here in the future unless its free... and even then.",0
"Wanted to like, close to home, didn't get a server for 10 minutes, just wasn't impressed with the food, maybe it was just a bad night.",0
I made the drive to this place after seeing the yelp reviews but I found a restaurant this location???,0
Once again I cannot say enough good things about the service and product from Maria. Our finished kitchen is beautiful!,0
"Wonderful Assortment of Sushi and Sashimi.  Very disappointed in Oyster Shooters, though.  We will be back.",0
Staff was very nice and my baby Pumpkin seemed to have enjoyed her stay. Next time I visit my family in Phoenix I will definitely use this facility again.,0
"You get what you pay for here.  For $2.50 per garment, you'll get your clothes dry-cleaned, but you could pay more elsewhere for a better pressing with fewer wrinkles.",0
Food was bland and uninteresting. Even for cheap Chinese the food was not good. I ended up throwing it all away.,0
Yummy Asian Fusion. Delicious Cocktails. Cool Ambiance.,0
I was in town for a business trip and found this nail salon by using my yelp app. Glad I did because I had a terrific pedi and shellac manicure!,0
"Their service was nice, but the quality of bagel wasn't what other reviewers said.  Very disappointed since I am new to Phoenix.  I don't know how other reviewers gave 5 stars.",0
Would never go back and never recommend.  Just paid $542 at our regular vet today (Friday) to fix the bad neuter they did Monday. My poor dog was in so much pain. Never. Again.,0
"First timer and it won't be the last. One of my new favorites! Amazing, friendly staff and an incredible choice of wine! Appetizers are delicious too!",0
I will never come back to this restaurant again. The worst service I've ever experienced.  Watch out for being overcharged on your bill.,0
My favorite pho place in the valley!! I got 2 bowls of soup and an amazingly delicious iced coffee for my friend and I for 13 bucks! It's a must try:),0
"A nice cozy place with respect to the environment but other than this nothing impressive. Food selection and imagination is poor, while the ingredients seem not to be fresh at all. Service is decent.",0
"let the tourists have their fancy strip, i am stickin' with the 'Tez!",0
"Same food and drinks, but older population compared to the tempe location. The atmosphere is more of a sports bar than a brewery.",0
Got me usually good food.Placed was packed.Steak was average and French fries cold.Service was fine.,0
Nice vibe to it but the food is just bland. Had spinach Alfredo pizza that lacked much taste. Very disappointed,0
"I like the buffet, but that's about it. The slots are tighter than a frog's asshole, and the place is smokier than hell.",0
"Awesome atmosphere, great service, delicious meal.  Pricier than you might expect for the Four Queens, but worth every penny.",0
Best Chinese food ever! And the staff is super nice as well :),0
"Really nice chill place, servers are good - but could stop by more to check on patrons.The crab cake appetizer are the best.  The only thing missing is mist fans outside for the hot weather.",0
Service is always horrible. A female server was training a new guy and she was very rude. Still tipped her good regardless of her rudeness. Food is always well prepared and tasty but the service could be much better.,0
"Love this restaurant! They have a great Tapas menu if you just want to come in for some drinks and snack, but their dinner menu is awesome too. Definitely a favorite!",0
"My wife loves the gnocci.  It's a bit cramped so make sure you have reservations.  The menu is small but I've always found at least on dish to my liking, just never been blown away by anything yet.",0
"This a a quinsential hole in the wall. But the food is really really goid, as are the beers.",0
"I called for a cab at 12:19 a.m., at 2:00 a.m. I still had no cab. Thank God a Vetscab drove by and stopped when we hailed him.",0
"4 stars for drinks, the setting & the view.  We didn't stay here, but really enjoyed an evening of drinks at the Buttes. Killer view.",0
"Service was great, but the food was definitely lackluster. However, the apple strudel dessert was fantastic. Next time\nwe will just go for the dessert!",0
"Nothing extraordinary here. Seated our large group outside in the cold when the interior restaurant was empty. Food was decent, same as any other in this chain.",0
These guys have the best scallops I've tasted in a landlocked area! I don't know how they do it. House Noodles with Scallops is a must try!!,0
Pretty good and a step above most fast food. Buffalo chicken sub with lettuce and tomatoes was solid and good-- enough for 2 meals.,0
"Love the food, but the last 2 times I went to this location, the wait staff was incredibly rude. I've started going to the Mesa location instead. This location used to be my absolute favorite, but not anymore. :(",0
"1 star for not having the special that's advertised on Yelp.  It's Sunday, and there's no 50% off sushi special.",0
This place SUCKS!  The food was horrible and the service was ridocuoulsly slow.  STAY AWAY,0
Mediocre and poorly made! You can get better quality food from Mcdonalds don't waste your time or money,0
"Amazing! Coffee Amazing! The food was soo good, I went 2 \nWeekends in a row! I'm\nDefinitely a fan!",0
"i always enjoy the concerts on Sunday evenings!  Great concessions and clean park to enjoy friends, family and music.  This is a great park to host any occasion for any age group.",0
This is a gem in this area.  Great staff Margie is a godsend.  Love this place.,0
"Good hummus, I had the cornish hen which was pretty good. my husbands beef dish was unimpressive. the wait staff was wonderful. maybe we need to try an alternate dish next time.",0
Nice place. Food was pretty good. Great service. Very respectful. Be careful if you are not used to eat spicy food.,0
"this place is super fire, I like this pizza better than the one next door which is also great.  its a must try.",0
I could literally eat here every day! I've never had a bad meal or bad service here...nuff said!,0
"Careful!  They tack on an extra $17 per night for a bogus \""service fee\"".  If have very little tolerance for deception.  This place was deceptive.",0
"Standard Chipotle fare - consistently good; not bad for corporate food - if you have a few minutes, there are a number of good local offerings within walking distance.",0
I am enjoying the bread. Will be back.,0
"Not exactly French food, but very satisfying.  Huge meatballs and a seriously tasty burger for a fair price will have my friends and I return.",0
Love body worlds! Can't wait to go back!  Puts a new spin on how you view the body.  I'm donating my body to science now.,0
"Waited 50 minutes for food, with no explanation or apology.  Rather defensive waitress offered us drink refills when one of our party complained.  \n\nWill not be stopping here again.",0
"I found a thin rope in my donut!!! Not very clean, I would say!",0
"This place has a back woods diner kind of feel, It's cute! But the food is nothing special. Muffins we pretty good though...",0
"Hey, it's Hooters, not fine dining. But I had a good burger, a stiff drink and a good time. Me and a few guys sat at the bar. The bartender was beautiful, attentive, and friendly.",0
The store is a joke And mismanaged. Every time I want to buy a door a window or carpeting there's never a person available to help and I always go across the street to Lowe's and i can place an order.,0
"My food came out cold, and the server was no where to be found, the drinks were good though.",0
"Come for the average joe, stay for the awesome service, get stuck catching up with everyone you've ever met who lives in the area.",0
Just okay-I went for a retirement party and was disappointed with what we paid for what we got. I like the location on Thomas way better and the servers were way more helpful too!,0
"This place smells, is in a crappy location and was a total dive. Went to 20 pubs last trip to Vegas, this was the worst and the bartender Matt is a total douche.",0
food was okay but the place is filthy. Tables were dirty. Dead flies in window seals. Window blinds have food residue splattered on them.  Ceiling fans have dust caked on them. Gross...,0
"Meh. We had the Groupon, couldn't use it on the lunch special so we ended up paying $19 for a mediocre large pizza. They did have a good cookie though.",0
The renovation makes this location one of the nicest in town... Perfect timing for the Publix opening next door.,0
The large employee guy with blonde hair was belligerent and trying to start fights with several us last night. He needs to be fired and needs to be some changes made.,0
Presidential Limo picked us up on time at the airport and at the hotel to go home. The driver was very nice and exactly what we ordered was delivered. I would use this company again.,0
"I love going to this place for lunch. They are well priced, always friendly and have decent food. My favorite part however is the fact that they serve tea with the meals. Its a great place to go with a few friends.",0
"Horrible service. 1 server doing everything, including hostess. Food mediocre. Definitely not worth a second try.",0
I wasn't impressed but tried going three different times. Food is ok service is fair and cost is a little much for what you get.,0
The employees are friendly and seem knowledgable but 2 hours to get a flat fixed is unacceptable. I will be taking my business elsewhere from now on.,0
"Worst Walmart on the planet went to get a cell phone and the clerk was the rudest person i have ever had the the pleasure of doing business with.  I will never spend another damn cent in that store again,",0
"Good bean dip, OK chips. OK green chile, although they need a medium green option.  I don't understand why when going from CO closer to Mexico I can't find anywhere with mole sauce?",0
"It's not very large, but it's a lot of fun. The penguins are great, and we really enjoyed how close you could get to all the birds. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable.",0
"As the recession has deepened, people's style of dress has declined in step; therefore, you can bring out your tasteless graffiti clad T shirts & fit right in now.",0
a lot of tacky decor\na lot of average wait help\na lot of messiness in the bathroom\na lot a lot of very average food\nand...\na lot of old people,0
My favorite bar. I moved away and it closed.\nSad,0
Had the buffet. Not many people in there tonight so the selection of pizza seemed minimal tonight. Overall - just ok pizza. Air conditioning must not have been working either.,0
"Delicious!! Had chicken, waffles, mac n cheese, greens, and cornbread. I'm stuffed. Excellent friendly service!!",0
"Great room - terrific pool & hot tub. Very accommodating staff. Beautiful locale. Quiet & peaceful, yet close to Scottsdale.",0
Ive been there several time for menu selection. There have a lot of good menu to choose from  But the service is not good whenever I go there and the cleanness is bad even though they have open kitchen,0
Staff is always friendly an helpful. The food is to die for! All of it even the desserts! Love the cheese pizza. The pieces are also very reasonable.,0
"Squirrel Hill classic!!! \n\nIt really is excellent pizza and the sauce is so perfect! The dining area isn't anything to write home about - but the pizza is, so its all balanced!",0
The get me my coffee AND it's a surprisingly clean restaurant. \n\nCan't be a $1.08 cup of joe.,0
"Absolutely the nicest folks here, the service is incredible. The food is always fresh and IMO very good. I've been going here for 5 years and the experience is consistently excellent.",0
"The service is so bad, I never even got to order, so I can't comment on the food or drinks. Twenty minutes and no one bothered to take our order.",0
"Service is awesome.  Staff is great, ordered tilapia burrito stuff with rice, sweet corn, purple cabbage, omg it was delicious, recommend this to anyone.",0
"Great place. I take my car there for everything. Inexpensive, friendly, and knowledgeable. They've fixed my tire, taped a broken hose temporarily, and done other things for no charge several times. I'd definitely recommend them.",0
The place is very small and not very busy but the service is great. Filled my wine glass to the TOP!,0
My local Chinese spot never disappoints me... Good service (for a Chinese restaurant at least) fresh and fast I go at least 4x a month!,0
"cherry blossom has good ramen, but their selection of ramen is VERY limited. everyone should go though, to see what real ramen is like. hopefully they'll expand their ramen selections in the future.",0
"Closed on Sundays.  Otherwise it's a typical bike shop, one or two guys running the place at a time so if there are more than one or two customers inside you have to wait a while to talk to anyone.",0
"Typical Chinese restaurant.  Stuff in brown sauce, light brown sauce, orange sauce, red sauce... ugh",0
"Food was bland and cold. Coffee was decaf. Mest up the orders, staff wasn't attentive.",0
"I have been going to this location for about nine years now and I have never had an issue. I have many things repaired, fixed over the years and each time its at a decent price and done quickly.",0
Definitely the nicest Waffle House I have ever been to. Really friendly service and delicious breakfast.,0
If I could give this restaurant negative stars I would! Mcdonalds service has gone so down hill and managers don't care. Never going back.,0
Delicious large bagels and bialys that toast really well.  Great selection of sandwiches and homemade salads. Quick and very friendly service.,0
3.5 stars is generous for this place if you are looking for a way over priced trendy place with mediocre food? Then this is the place for you.,0
"Had a lower face lift plus co2 laser last Oct 2014.  Cost over $16,000 was left with scar down my neck from a 2nd modifcation and sagging skin on jaw line.  Not happy with results.",0
Fast very friendly service. Especially love the fish taco's. Taco Tuesday is the best.,0
Had to come get my free birthday burger with my family. I had the Whiskey River BBQ burger. It was a nice size and the fries were good as usual.and we had good prompt service even though they were really busy that day.,0
People honestly review airports? As if you have options? As if you honestly decide whether or not to visit a city because of it's airport? The fact this this has 800+ reviews blew my mind!,0
Horrible!! Food is cheap and now I know why.,0
Not good. OCB is not a place for quality dining. It is best suited for folks who prefer quantity over quality.,0
"Good chips but that's about all, I decided to give them a try because of the yelp reviews and was disappointed, guess I'll keep looking for descent Mexican food.",0
This place used to be so great. Not anymore... Terrible the last 3 times I've been in! So sad.,0
"Menu has a good variety, appealing to many individuals.  Always curious what the Non Traditional Perogies are each time we are there.  Fun atmosphere; however, the meal/food service can be slow @ times.",0
"Get doughnuts from the QT up the street, they are fresher, cheaper, and faster.",0
"Huge, delicious, decently priced burger.",0
Food is always good. Service is a little slow but they are super friendly. Thai hot is actually hot! Better then the thai restaurants down town for sure,0
Efficient Hertz.  I came to Phoenix on an evening flight and everything was taken care of - no craziness and extremely efficient.  Friendly service when I left so all was well. 3 Stars.,0
If you find yourself eating here don't.  Walk across the street to krung Siam.  That being said it was clean.  papaya salad was the only thing worth mentioning.,0
"Had a great dinner there tonight. Clean, friendly, great deal on delicious food. Good sized portions for a great price. We will definitely go back soon.",0
"What a nice venue for a concert, we have been here several times for other events and had a great time.",0
Went here for the first time and had breakfast. The hashbrowns and pancakes were awesome. Can't wait to go back for lunch sometime.,0
"Chicken fried steak more like chicken fried doodoo, nastiest chicken fried steak I ever had in my life. I'll stick to the breakfast menu.",0
I love this spot! Lisa is is amazing and the girls are all so friendly! I always feel so relaxed when I leave.,0
Old school steak house feel but a good spot to hit if you son't want to head downtown for some real grubbing!,0
"Nice staff, great hours! Dirty and damaged furniture, due to excessive wear. My mocha with 0.25 the chocolate was still super nauseating with sugar.",0
Typical strip mall restaurant in South Scottsdale.  Looks totally outdated inside.  Covering up pasta with an overdose of sauce should be criminal. Clearly no love for food in the kitchen. So not impressed.,0
The waitress are not hot at all...and honestly i think they can think of better outfit than orange boyshorts and skin color stockings. \nFood is just like other sports bars. Not a fan of the wings,0
My wife said let's try this new place I was hesitant to try Italian drive-through food.But I must say it was way better than the Olive Garden!,0
Horrible food not child friendly horrible waiter. I understand it's the oldest restaurant but it stinks not coming again,0
Was there Friday morning around 9am- rudest young guy working the order window and took our payment. That guy has no business in the customer service industry.,0
Food still tastes like doo doo.\n\nAnd the service is still on par with the food.\n\nCaveat emptor.,0
Love Pizza Monday 1/2 on any pizza...... Pizza is good \nI have try the wings. But There on my list for Pizza Mondays\nBusy place Order early...,0
"Food is decent. Nothing special, but certainly edible. We liked the cheese curds. Service was good. Server was definitely friendly even though they were busy. Be prepared, though.....it's loud!",0
Food was good and creative.  I will be going back.,0
"As stated in another post, I believe this has closed, and been replaced by Rivers American Grill, which i gave 4 star for good bar food.  Apparently they have pizza as well (guess they left the oven behind?).",0
"Wow, not the place you want to patronize if you like customer service as part of your shopping experience.  That'll teach me for trying to patronize \""the little guy\"". Unfortunately, that's why they are where they are.",0
"Solid hotel, pretty hard beds but clean. Great water pressure and fantastic location.  Be sure to join their club for free in room wifi.",0
"I don't usually leave yelp reviews, let alone nasty ones, but I just got a godawful haircut from a godawful barber at this place. Ruined my day.",0
The BEST HAPPT HOUR Spot in Town! Great Italian Food & Import Beers on tap.  This is our secret spot tnat has become quite popular! You Simply MUST Try It!,0
Not all the electrical outlets at the Recharge Zone work (located in between gates C7 and C14).,0
the worst gentlemens club ive ever been to! i was charged $240 for a 15 minute dance! my bar tab was $100 for 4 drinks! they will steal your money! avoid at all costs!,0
It took over an hour to get our food. Don't go on a Sunday after church.,0
"Pizza Hut never tastes the same. This location tasted unusually different. The best Pizza Hut is in anthem highlands. Next time I'm in the mood for pizza, I'll be going to them.",0
"My first time here, this salon came highly recommended. I'll definitely be back when i'm in town! Clean space and friendly staff and prices are reasonable. My pedi and mani were thorough and delightful.",0
"Ok hotel. Nothing special. Is located right across from the Epicenter so if you want quiet on the weekends, probably not the best place to stay.",0
Always receive excellent service.   Pizza's are amazing there.  The toppings are generous.,0
This place is pretty awesome. It's a tiny place and it gets packed but the drinks are good and the people are pretty awesome as well. It's another awesome dive and find in the Old Town area.,0
It is better than 3 stars but not quite 4.  They have some pretty good dishes.  The vegi burger was amazing!,0
The new French menu has left out some of our favorites and has replaced them with unispired so-called French items. Not a good idea. This is not a French restaurant! Where is the Santa Fe omelette???,0
"First time here in a very long time, service was good, food was just OK. Probably won't be back, too many other eateries in Mesa to try.",0
Below average bagels. Eggs had no taste. Fast service.,0
"Very nice atmosphere, and GREATservice.  Everyone is extemely attentive and responsive.  A quality experience.",0
"I enjoy eating at mimi's cafe. I try to go there at least 1 or 2 times monthly. Breakfast, lunch or dinner you can always count on great food, service and atmosphere while dining with friends, family or even by yourself.",0
Loved this place! I had the calamari and came with rice and eggplant slice. Very delicious and the waiter did a great job!,0
"Besides the fact they take awhile to bring your food, I love this place. Me and friends come here all the time when we're craving Chinese food. Delicious!!",0
"What a hidden gem in the South Side! Wonderful back patio area makes you feel like you've been whisked off to Italy. The eggplant rolls were beyond amazing. Sweet, personal service. Note: Cash only and BYOB.",0
"Excellent neighborhood place, great food, very reasonably priced. I will go vack again and again.",0
we had breakfast there yesterday huevos rancheros for me ham and egg burrito for the wife nothing great senior taco out rocks this place  50-1 on the breakfast front,0
"Great place for family and friends to enjoy. Comfortable, great atmosphere and good service. Plenty of TV's to watch your favorite sports.",0
"Disappointing food, little high priced for what you get.",0
Went to step brothers soccer game here. Very impressive sports center.,0
I love this place!  They always have the best country food and the service is always good.,0
"Aweful service. You don't feel welcome at this place. I live close by and thought i d have a place to go if i don't want to drive but they won't see me or my friends, never again!",0
The chickens enchiladas were absolutely amazing!!!!!! Some of the best Mexican food I have had in a very long time.  I would totally recommend this place and if you want really good Mexican food this place is it!,0
"Great atmosphere, good service. Excellent food. I ordered the taco, enchilada, tostada combo. Very delicious. Loved the beans and rice.",0
Dropped in fir breakfast twice while we were in Gilbert.The Blueberry Pancakes were to die for.I've never tasted any so good.,0
"Not stupendous comida, but the staff is friendly and they usually have either spanish soap operas or futbol on TV. Good prices and non-corporate chain food tastes better!",0
"Its what you expect, hot wings, beer, sports nothing to write home about but not bad either.",0
"While the waitress was very sweet and friendly, itt was 30-40 minutes before the food arrived. There is also a random character at the counter starring at people, making things a little uncomfortable.",0
Good spice levels. Chicken tikka masala and samosas were the most popular with our group. Did not enjoy the shrimp curry.\nGreat friendly and helpful service.,0
"Horrible pizza, paid $20 for a large pizza and the mushrooms are from a can. I rather have purchased a pizza from the grocery store for $10",0
Family Friendly for over 40 years!!! After a few days on the Vegas strip make your way home to Phoenix and be sure to stop here for your best breakfast experience. Home Made Cooking at it's finest.,0
"Top of my list when looking for Mediterranean food. The prices are right, the servings plentiful and the food is always top quality.",0
Though it is a place for kids I personally have seen much better park for kids.There are very minimal rides and all are old.Nothing new..,0
"This is very cheap food - the eggs and bacon are good, veggie omelet not so much.  Service is amazing and you are really made to feel welcome - I think the better call is the pancakes or french toast.",0
"It's bland old white people food, if you like that sort of thing ;) Sort of like a more pricey version of Denny's.",0
"We always somehow make our way here when we come to Vegas. This place is always packed, for good reason. The food is great and the service is fast. Big bonus points for being open 24 hours. Need one of these in Seattle!",0
"The breakfast (ham & cheese omelet) was the best, but the service was not the best. The toast was cold, my wifes blueberry pancake wad terrible.",0
Average pizza at best and sub-par appetizers. Decent beer specials are only upside. Walk across the street and eat at Fuel for some real pizza.,0
"Andy's took amazing care of my vehicle.  From detailed auto body work, fair estimates to sensitivity for how long I had a rental vehicle, Tim and his team of technicians went above and beyond!  Highly recommend!!",0
"Great food even better ambiance. If the menu was more diverse, especially the dessert portion, this review would be even better. Will be coming back to Bandera again for sure.",0
"A plus sushi in the desert! Fantastic staff, always make us feel very welcome, extremely accommodating with our 2 year old, who absolutely loves the Cali rolls and salmon sashimi. Best sushi in town by a country mile",0
"Brunch is El Dorado's savior.  As a food fight restaurant goes, I still think they have the worst service of any.  I would give their service a six, and their food and 8.",0
Theaters are clean and we'll kept.  Staff are friendly.  Popcorn is marginal at best stale!,0
"Fairly mediocre, even by the relatively modest standards of Home Depot. Unfortunately, this is probably the best you're going to do for hardware in most of Pittsburgh.",0
"As far as airports go, it's fine. Pretty efficient, people working there are nice. Don't bother with the slot machines- they don't pay for CRAP! Then again, who would really expect them to, right?",0
"I've eaten here a couple times, once for breakfast and once for dinner.  The food is good but overpriced for the amount you get.  The employees were nice and the service was fast.",0
Best ever. Great service. Nice people --love my boots,0
Great office! The office consists of very dedicated staff members that love their job-and it shows. Both dentists on board take great care of their patients. they take the time to know the individual and tailors to each persons needs.,0
"The complementary chips were a good surprise. The taco, however, was only average. I got the mahi mahi taco and it tasted bland. If I had some BBQ sauce I'd put it on. Service was very good though.",0
Office staff talks snarky behind your back. Was waiting in back for my patient room and heard them saying mean things about another patient. Not cool.,0
Not only was the food brunt but the customer service is ridiculous! Extremely rude! Make sure to triple check your order before handing the driver a tip!,0
Only issue I have is there is typically no place to park if you drive. Oh and the bums taking up all the seats outside. WTF??,0
"It is lovely little theater that offers a great movie experience. Never a crowd, theater is clean and the snacks are what you would expect - popcorn, candy and soda. Stop by Wine Expression before or after and have a great afternoon",0
"I thought I left a review for this place. I was disappointed with the selection, a lot of the bags looked old and cheap.",0
"\""Boybershop\"" bring your boys in for the full treatment. Omar did a great job trimming up our 2.5 year old!",0
Great place to get a pizza. It's always good and very consistent. The only complaint I have is their hours but it's a small ran family business.,0
We read the reviews and stopped in this evening. The salad was great and plenty. The pizza was fresh and delicious. We will definitely go there again. Great neighborhood restaurant.,0
Terrible service. Love when the bartenders are drinking more than you. Not to mention harass you about playing the machines,0
Friendly service. Just doesn't compare to dim sum in Cali.,0
Newfound place to go!! Cheap drinks good atmosphere. If you gamble too it's not gonna cost you a fortune for one bet. The cafe nachos are horrible though.,0
"This place makes such great food and the store is fun to shop in while you wait. They make their own English muffins, which are so freakin good, you'll wonder why no other bakery has ever made them.",0
Great smoothies. Lots of options - almost too many to make a decision. But very tasty and great protein options.,0
"If you're looking for a great corner dive with interesting folks, witty bartenders, decent bar food, cheap drinks, low drama, and weekly sex trivia, you found it.",0
Food is decent. Serving time is mediocre at best. Bibimbap sauce literally redeemed my meal. Price is somewhat higher than expected.,0
"Good lunch Chinese food, they deliver also.  It is nice to get out of the office though for a hot meal.  :-)",0
"I didn't find the food all that flavorable, the service isn't great, and it's definitely not worth the price.",0
"I or someone I have been with has gotten food poisoning 3 times from this grocery/pizzeria.  That's 3 separate occasions, I have stopped going here at all!",0
The drive through is soooooo slow. What's up with that?,0
A family member recently was sent to this facility after a joint replacement. Bottom line: You could die in there and nobody would notice for several hours.,0
"We loved it here! The food was amazing, it came out so fast, and our waitress was the sweetest lady ever.",0
Pho ga chicken was dried out. The spring rolls were the smallest portion I've ever seen & the peanut sauce was watered down. I've tried eating here twice. I give up,0
This is always one of my favorite stops when visiting the Strip. A wide variety of party favors and Pittsburgh paraphernalia.,0
"I gotta say they've upgraded their menu. The waitress was greatr. The prices are good. Will go back, now.",0
Try the moo shu pork!!  It's great to watch the staff wrap each roll using chop sticks. Such skill. I have none!,0
"It's Ihop, good when nothing else is open and you want breakfast.",0
I will no longer buy bagels here anymore. No matter which kind you buy they all taste like an onion/garlic bagel...even the cinnamon sugar!,0
Chips & salsa AND bean dip.  Salsa seems to have improved.  \nGreen chile con carne.  Mmm.,0
Got a full set today and they look so bad. So many flaws. The polish is sloppy. They don't look neat and clean.,0
"Taco's! I mean really it is a Taco Bell. Apparently they got an \""A\"" from the health department on 6/27/2013....",0
"My favorite for Pt. Breeze/Pittsburgh East End. Flat New York style, not greasy, timely delivery, they know my orders!",0
Such a love hate with this place. \nIt's always cheap place to shop. \nIt is a bit unorganized inside.,0
Too pricey for the food. The meal I had was just ok. My MIL had a terrible loud garlic pasta. It was stinky. They were also not too happy to see my two kids in tow.,0
This is a great place and the people are the friendliest. I really enjoy their food. It is always fresh. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. The management is the best!,0
"Excellent service, great food. Nachitos came out and made me laugh, as the name implies that they are small. They are not. Great fajitas too.",0
I highly recommend. Great professional service. My car looks awesome. Work was done in a timely manner and when I picked up my car it was spotless inside and out. Nice to deal with local business who takes pride in their work..,0
Beautiful and clean Safeway in Tempe. The medicine and liquor aisle are in their own section and the shelves are all lit! It was beautiful! Will definitely go here again.,0
"So we have been here for about 35 minutes and we have not even receive water, there not even pack and the waitress seem like they are just lounging around. So rude.",0
They used to have some awesome Tortas on the menu but they sometimes have the bread if you ask they can make them.  I really like the fish tacos omnomnom,0
Over salted food. Sort of crappy service. The rice was way too sticky. Not sure why this place is rated so highly.,0
"I'm painting my living room and have no time to cook, I can't say this is reviewable its dominos... The delivery guys are really friendly and courteous.",0
"If I could give them zero stars, I would. Extremely rude staff. Horrible customer service.",0
"Stunningly beautiful setting.  Great pools, just an absolutely iconic hotel.\n\nAn added bonus is that you can use Starwood points!",0
I got so sick and was throwing up after eating there! I have never been back since. And normally I never get sick to my stomach. I don't trust their food. And it is so overprized and overrated.,0
Ate here twice.  Thought it was dirty and didn't find the food very good at all.,0
Went here with a friend in 2011. Kind of disappointed to find out the cast only works Monday thru Friday. It was very busy. Not like on the show where there is nobody inside.,0
"After all the good reviews I have to say I was disappointed. Anything fried was overdone, and the chicken and veggie dish was overpriced and bland. The customer service was great, but the food was expensive and sub-par.",0
"This venue seems newer and improved from the Higley location, but the quality of the produce is so much less. Only one of the five items I purchased was edible.",0
"We came here on a gift card, thank god!  the food is terrible, as if they are trying to cut costs with cheap product.  Service is good, food is a mess.",0
Bring cash only. Good for an after dinner drink.,0
superbe terrasse au bord du jardin des fontaines.;tr\u00e9s romantique..;bonne cuisine un peu spicy,0
"Good food, good drinks. Great place to grab lunch, great place to watch an Illinois game, and still a good place to stop by at night. I hope they still have Magic Hat on tap.",0
Gross!! I tried it cuz I woke across the street but OMG... dry ass food... I wanted to puke!!,0
"Food was very good. Fagiole had nice hint of thyme, and cannelloni was quite hearty. Decor only so-so. Staff friendly and helpful.",0
"the atmosphere, homemade vegetables, and drink specials sealed the deal for me.\n\nthe cornbread not so much, could use some more salt and flavor.",0
"For a simple egg breakfast, it was pretty decent! I would go there and order it again!",0
"The owner looks like she comes from a refuge camp, totally unkempt.\nVery crowed seating, but food ok nothing special at all.",0
Food was only just ok and service was even worse.\n\nThere's plenty of other places you can go to for breakfast  - even Eat'N'Park would be better but hit up a place like Ritter's instead.,0
"This place was cute and clean and had nice personality, but when it came to the food it was very ordinary. These are dishes you can throw together yourself if you wanted. Nothing spectacular at all, I wouldn't come back to this place.",0
"Pretty good. But there are lots of pretty good Mexican joints out there. Green salsa tasty and HOT. Very reasonable, hot tasty food. Red sauce  2-3 stars stick with green sauce. Would stop again if in the area.",0
The lady on the phone - owner's daughter - spoke somewhat rudely and refused to accept cash and hung up on me. lol...Make sure you have a credit card else they won't accept your order. You've been warned.,0
"Great customer service checking out today, it's alway nice to have a knowledgeable cashier.",0
"Fast service, lentil and spicy italian sausage soup was yummy. Main course was Salmon, scallops and shrimp \""The Damian\"", sauces were great not heavy and seafood cooked just right.",0
Fall in love with the food everytime I eat here!,0
"I ordered the Bourbon chicken and shrimp. It tasted super good. I was disappointed a little, because it comes with saut\u00e9ed onions and \""mushrooms\"". I got no mushrooms",0
"Typical Hooters... Great wings and fries. Wings were excellent. We tried the honey wings. The burgers were dressed well but really bland. No season at all. Overall, a typical Hooters experience.",0
"Not impressed. My 29 dollar pizza was not only cold when it showed up, but flavorless as well. At least my toddlers seem to like it...",0
Does this place still exist?  I drove around this area for 15 minutes looking and the best I can gather is that this Lowe's got converted into a Steinmart.  Lame.,0
"Come here to fill yourself up with veggies, simple pastas, soups and some soft serve ice cream.  Each location is the same and you can have your food exactly the way you want!",0
My favorite pizza place when I come to visit my family up this way. Worked at one when I was 16 lol. Husband loves the thin crust pizza. Breadsticks are great too,0
"A tad pricy, average portions, but it's the best chinese food I've had in the states of Pennsylvania and Michigan",0
All you can eat BBQ! The steamed egg was the best dish. The marinated foods were really sweet.,0
Very yummy.  Great for vegetarians and non alike.,0
One of my favorite places to eat if I'm looking for cheap and fast :),0
"Do not waste your time playing this course. Looks like they gave up on maintance. Horrible conditions, bunkers don't have sand, greens are bumpy. Flag stick are broken. Spend your money elsewhere!!",0
10% discount for being in the union. Not too shabby. Good selection of shoes for the working man.,0
I like this place. The food is pretty good and it's a good value. But how come no napkins in the dining room? I also might encourage management to wash and/or replace the plastic bowls they use for chips.,0
"well, that was fast! my sandwich was made before i even finished paying.\n\nThe bread wasn't anything to write home about. \n\n\nThe whole experience was simple, fast, and easy.",0
Okay I like this place but prices have gotten higher... And the man that works here always looks at everyone like they are going to steal or something! It not like I wanna pocket a 2 dollar nail art! Customer service sucks,0
"A small, unassuming salon tucked into a corner of a strip mall. The prices are great ($19 for pedi) and the service is really good. A great find!",0
Everyone is right. This airline also sucks. Mostly because every time I fly US Airways I experience:\n\na) Check-in lines out the door\nb) Airplanes from the Nixon administration era.,0
The food was okay. Neither my friend nor I thought the food was very good. \nThe service was terribly slow. It took a long time after we finished our meal to get the check and even longer to pay for it.,0
Shocked this place has 4 stars. First off you can always tell if a Mexican food place is good based on the beans and the salsa. Well guess what both suck! Eat at el molino's and you will never come here again!,0
"I'm not a fan of watered down vinegar sauce with a few specs of tomato at all.  I gave it two-stars just not to be a jerk, but I tell everyone not to go here.",0
Enjoyed breakfast this morning and our waitress Cece was the best.  Definitely recommend this place.,0
Tried this place for the first time. Ok menu would have been better with more options. Food was good with a lot of great flavor. Would dine there again but would get it as take out.,0
For a concert arena it was really big and I liked it. Afterwards it got very crowded and I felt a bit uncomfortable. Overall- nice place.,0
"We eat here a couple of time a month, the food is always good and the service is good.  The lunch prices are great for a sit-down.",0
"Terrible service, the worst I've ever had in town. Don't come here, plenty of good places for food around town. The old lady at the front door was so rude.",0
We waited for about an hour for a table.  It was well worth the wait!  The pizza and calzone were amazing.  Maria was a fantastic server!  We will definitely be back and bring others with us!,0
"This hotel has so much potential and looks like it was. Staff very nice, furnishings and decor very nice but you can see the building and mechanicals crumble in front of you.",0
Went for lunch  closed   All signs are off the building no notice. What happened?   Pfft gone!,0
Extremely over-priced!  I was quoted over $600 for a particular repair.  I took the vehicle down the road to Farm-n-Fleet and got the same repair done for $315.,0
Thanks for the reply. I provided direct feedback through the Massage Envy survey six days ago.,0
Best sports bar in town bar none.  Great food.  Golden Tee.  Dozens of TVs.  No reason to watch a game anywhere else.,0
All of Old Chicago's food is good & their beer selection is great. \n\nI can tell this place is managed really well & the customer service is really good.,0
"Place has been here for decades. I've never had a bad meal here, and the wait staff are very very friendly. The food is excellent and they have the best hot and sour soup I've ever had!",0
"Out of the apple cinnamon bagels, when asked if they would bake more, they said \""not today\"".",0
"Other then the high prices, I was on the phone for almost an hour to add ONE package! I beg of you to hire employees with some type CUSTOMER SERVICE BACKGROUND!",0
Blueberry pancakes were very bland.  No flavor at all.  Excellent service however.,0
Great shop with friendly knowledgeable staff.  Well stocked for all mountain and road biking needs.,0
"We were not greeted during the 5 minutes that we browsed the store while the salesmen were on their cellphones behind the counter, so we walked out. Prices of safes 'on sale' were outrageous.",0
Meh. Used to eat here years ago and it was much better. BBQ pork fried rice had an off taste. Beef (from beef and broccoli) was chewy. Egg roll was good I guess. Won't be ordering again.,0
This might be the worst food I have ever eaten.\nAt least I didn't get sick.,0
I love this location! Double points for being walking distance from our condo. With a huge patio this Starbucks is our go to coffee shop. Their baristas are always so pleasant and upbeat.,0
"I usually enjoyed their bagels and now they even have wifi, but the btl avocado thin bagel...LAME, you seriously don't have wheat thin bagels?",0
Decent food for the price.   Not great but not bad.  Kids like it.  One exception is the pot stickers.   Those are really good.,0
"Always have to go to sonic when in Arizona! The food is very cheap and good,however my favorite thing on the menu would have to be the fresh banana shake.",0
"Pathetic place, worst food. I tried vegetarian food for dinner buffet and it was no where close to average food. Decided never to visit this place again.",0
"I had a 1 day notice to have a birthday party for 20 people. Called Red devil at 8:30pm and made a reservation for 20 the next day. The food was great, the service was great Thanks so much!",0
"I wish the employees would have some aloha spirit like the posters say in the hallways,\nBut Nope they don't,",0
Good service. I had the #1 and the chili relleno was awesome and they use shredded beef in the taco versus ground. Tableside guacamole was good. The price is.in the middle but worth it.,0
I will NEVER return to this establishment for my manicure. The service was very poor. I also witnessed one of the nail technicians (male) yelling at a customer. Very unprofessional and rude.,0
This Kmart is one of the worst I gone to. It is very quiet and the people aren't very friendly. The shelves weren't very well stocked and there were things a mess in the aisles.,0
"Food is overrated. Nothing special here. The sports memorabilia and ambience is great. Again, food is just ok but a cool place to look around.",0
Fantastic dining experience that is well worth the price. Great service with delicious items and nice atmosphere. One of my favorites in Sin City!,0
"I walked in and then straight back out.  Also, there was an attack in the parking lot involving a hammer.",0
Great place for really good food.  My husband and I have always enjoyed everything that we have had at Wally's\nJane Lynch,0
"They had some of the worst customer service I have ever seen. After having drinks spilled all over our table, it all went downhill. The food was okay, but even the best food in town couldn't excuse their poor service.",0
"as far as \""sit down\"" fast food goes. it wasnt bad.. it was the first one in a while i went to where the food was actually good and the staff was nice. id go back..",0
I love the atmosphere and the food. Not a fan of beer or wine as my only options. And I hate forced valet parking. If it weren't for the forced valet parking I would visit more often.,0
I really enjoy this place. It is always busy and the food and service are great. It's the small town resturant in the big city.,0
This time the food was not as good as the first time. The meatballs were heavy & dry. The pasta sauce was just too too sweet! We were really sad to see the quality of their dishes going down,0
The staff at this Whole Foods is unprofessional.   And the prepared food is typically awful.,0
Very friendly great customer service and fresh produce. Very convenient and affordable.,0
"Okay spot for lunch.  The salads are pretty good.  A little pricey for what you get.  I wouldn't drive here to eat lunch, but if you work within walking distance it is a reasonable alternative.",0
Yikes! Spinach dip was super salty (more like salt-lick) and bruschetta is a cheap Postino clone. At least the Bree plate was okay.,0
"Jill, Tom and Al are the very best and provide A+ service consistently. The food is second to none.",0
Very disappointed in takeout dinners this evening.  Cashew chicken had few or no cashews.  Chicken in the Curry chicken fried rice was undercooked.  Governor's Beef lacked flavor.,0
Come here instead of D's if you need to buy cases of beer. They're cheaper than D's and everything is easy to find. Thanks to the peeps at D's for the referral.,0
"Decent spot in the mall for coffee that isn't overly dark (Starbucks downstairs), cookies that are tasty, and some soup/sandwich options that are much better than the offerings at merchants there in the food court.",0
"The positive is that the menu has something for everyone to choose. The negative? You'll wait forever for it, while listening to smoove jazz, and then get diarrhea.",0
Clean. Machines well managed. Friendly staff. Downside is it isn't a 24 hour laundromat. Location is within a reasonable distance from home.,0
"I love the $6 Guac/bacon cheeseburger, and the ice cream cookie sandwich...but that's it. If ordering chicken in the drive thru...expect to wait...and wait.",0
"I've been to cracker barrel twice. The food was ok, I agree with Thomas that the food can be bland. Warning-if its busy don't expect to be able to carry on a conversation very easily. Can be really loud",0
"Good waffles, I guess they should have since that's what their name is....lol\nAsked for crispy bacon but not as the way I like it.",0
"I like this airport, easy to navigate, the slot machines make me smile.  There seem to be more restaurants here than any other airport.  The food was good in all areas, restrooms were clean and there are pleanty of them.",0
"Really a nice restaurant, although not very many veggie maki options which was really disappointing. Expect to pay a decent price for the atmosphere as well.",0
Two of my best friends got married here a couple of weeks ago and it was a beautiful venue! I was impressed with everything and the lady who was taking care of the event was great.,0
Overpriced goods but the staff is nice. SRP pay center in this store is handy.,0
This place was amazing and had amazing food! The prices were great and the service was wonderful. Everything is served beautifully and I really enjoyed my meal! I will be coming here again!,0
The food was great the service was average. I ordered an appetizer a big salad and a meal all top notch. Everything was cooked properly and delicious I can't wait to be back.,0
"This place was great! We had several different dishes, but the chorizo hash was the winner. \n\nExpect a bit of a wait, but it's worth it.",0
Service is great. Outside seating in mild weather is awesome. Chicken Mac and Sausage Mac were both great. Veggie pizza was fresh and yummy. Beer sampler was fun to try!,0
Rules made by men. Check them before you book this church to get married or any other event. Their restrictions are far beyond respect and more on the ridiculous side. Stay away from this church.,0
I brought 4 pairs of dress shoes here that I thought were dead forever and Mike's brought them back to life!! Very reasonable pricing and work done very fast. Best shoe repair in Vegas,0
"Horrible food. It takes real effort to botch up a turkey sandwich...so because of their obvious diligence in that regard, I'm giving them one star.",0
"This  place is Awesome!  Clean, fresh air, fabulous  breakfast, friendly staff A+ rating. Highly recommend.",0
This place is awesome! I am so glad we came here instead. Food was great and service was awesome! Come here if u want some awesome Mexican food!,0
"Fast checkout surprised to see that there wasn't many shoppers, place was nice and neat had a weird guy look at me kinda scared lol bt other dan dat it was ok. Nothing wow or bad either jst neutral.",0
Best wings ever!!!! There is no place that can stand near this place for wings.,0
BBQ chicken. Best in Charlotte. Bring a bib---or turn your cape around.,0
So the place is 80% empty late on a Sunday afternoon but the hostess feels that she has to seat everyone next to each other.  It's not about the wait staff... It's about the customers!,0
It's cheap and is open at 6 a.m.  This is pretty much the only pros I can think of this place.,0
"This pizza is amazing! New York style in North Carolina. The owner is really cool, talked to us about where he gets his ingredients and his philosophy on his restaurant.",0
Me & some friends came here for lunch but an hour pass by & we never received our food... we end up leaving because our lunch time was over... never coming back to this restaurant,0
"Large selection but high prices, unhelpful staff and dust on the cigars make this place terrible. Spend your money at leaf and bean or allegheny smokeworks, at least there they appreciate their customers",0
This place was the highlight of my Phoenix trip.  Walking in was like discovering a parallel universe.\n\nI can't imagine that the new place could match the feel of the old......,0
"Walked in here one night randomly spoke to the owner and he hooked me up on a pizza. It was really good, the sauce is really tasty. I would def come back.",0
I played today on a Tuesday. Play was a little slow at first but picked up. Course was in good shape. Pro shop staff was friendly. I would play here again.,0
"Went today for an oil change and they're closed, for lease sign up and no one at the place, it appears HondaTronics is no more (hopefully they find a new location)",0
"Denver broncos bar. Good locals hang, been there before but nothing special if your from out of town looking for something exciting.",0
"Average everyday bar, with a ton of car parts and pictures around. The staff was friendly, and they have a cool little game room area upstairs with couches and bar games. The food I had was your typical bar food.",0
"The food here was average. I was surprised at how dingy it was, felt unclean. Most of all, the waitress was terrible. I will never go back here.",0
Their seafood soup sucks: no variety and soup base is just fried onions in water. And we had to send it back because the soup was warm.   Order something else.,0
"Not what I was expecting at all. The chicken my party ordered was dry and sad. \n\nThe portions were big though, considering where they are located and their price you expect better quality.",0
"Horrible,  thirty minutes for drinks and an hour thirty for food. Simply horrible.",0
Very clean and updated rooms. The bed was comfortable. The staff was pleasant. I was also impressed by the free breakfast & coffee every morning. I don't have a single complaint about this hotel. Had a great stay!,0
Beautiful flowers. Owned by sisters who are very knowledgeable. Created unique wedding arrangements. Reasonably priced. Let me choose exactly the colors I wanted. A very happy bride.,0
Good pizza and wings and very nice people. You can't beat the lunch special for $5.00. I would recommend.,0
Miso Ramen is just ok. Sashimi and Roll combo is just ok.\nGood service :-),0
I had the Rigatoni Alla Bolognese and would definitely order it again.  I'm not sure about the value because the company picked up the tab,0
Eh. Lost its mojo when Frank sold.,0
"Kinda a love/hate relationship with McCarran.  You love it when you land, but you might also love it or hate it when you leave!!",0
The staff is nice the place is nice but it is WAY overpriced.  They take advantage of people in emotional states and pick their pockets.  Also way under staffed for emergcies,0
The cashiers up front and the management sucks. Was with a friend who was trying on a wig and the manager was yelling at her let a kid. Disrespectful. Only go here where its a product that no other store carries,0
UPDATE! Received an email from the owner which was a little intimidating stated that I should remove my post. Kinda think they should improve customer service then send an email.,0
"Just to let everyone know, Namaste Indian Restaurant has moved (January 2013) from it's old location in the Banksville Plaza to 1150 Banksville Rd, adjacent to The Days Inn. I've notified Yelp.",0
My husband and I both got sick after eating here.  How come there is always a line on the weekend?,0
"For the second time my \""mini\"" garlic knots came burnt amd swimming in oil. My pizza arrived cold and late (1 hour).  I don't understand how the garlic knots even made it out the door. Terrible.",0
Run of the mill steak and seafood at high end prices.  Service mediocre.  Stay at home rather than spend your money here. Not really worth a lengthy review.,0
Remember that your admission to these is essential to keeping them open and maintaining their wildlife. Remind yourself that each species is a piece in the jigsaw puzzle of the ecosystem. Invite your friends to come and meet the residents!,0
"IHOP used to be good, but in recent years has become overpriced and very mediocre. You have to practically beg for warm syrup at this place. Seriously?",0
Absolutely love Barrett Jackson - gets better every year. Great cars & awesome food vendors.,0
The food ad no flavor and the foods that say spicy have no heat the only good thing was pot stickers,0
Great place! Friendly staff. Good music and awesome beer selection. I reco Bells two hearted ale!,0
"Was very good. Love finding these little local off the main drag local places to eat. Food was great, service very good. Would go back again.",0
"1.5 / 5 - Beef Pho: Kind of bland tasting\n2.0 / 5 - Pork Chop: Not much meat and as much flavor as I'm used to, but still good.",0
I love all you can eat buffet and the stake house the cafe restraunt I eat slots of food and I am still skinny I love that ever play machines there and sports tickets,0
I'm really disappointed. The experience was really bad. The food was under-seasoned. I prefer Olive Garden over Carrabba for sure. \nI don't think I will come back to this chain.,0
Great menu and service is fantastic. Lunch at noon with five of us took less than hour and portions. I will make this my new go to lunch spot with clients and friends alike.,0
Fake five star reviews by anonymous doesn't change anything. I bet they're employees of that establishment.,0
Took literally 45 minutes in the drive thru to get my food with no apology for the delay. Absolutely ridiculous.,0
Ordered a French Dip for delivery. When I received my order I noticed that all of the Dipping Sauce had spilled into the bag. Sandwich was still good though. They could probably be more cautious when delivering food however.,0
Stopped in for lunch before a Bucs game. Great service and food.  Hamburger was thick and juicy cooked perfectly.  Service is excellent.  I can highly recommend SoHo as your pre Bucco stop.,0
"Average food, average service. Marinara sauce over spaghetti was far too sweet. Tasted like canned. Italian sausage was bland at best. Wine selection was average and overpriced.  Would not recommend.",0
"Their chicken BBQ pizza is among the greaseiest I've ever consumed, but their beer selection is good, atmosphere is pleasant, and service is friendly.",0
I love this store. It is adorable and you are able to pick up some unique pieces. The staff is friendly and I enjoyed stopping in.,0
"We've tried just about everywhere is Henderson and believe me, Weiss has the best breakfast in town!",0
GREAT Mexican joint! I always get the Baja Chicken Burro. Mmm!,0
Nice little breakfast place. My only gripes have to do with the laws of Arizona regarding dogs.,0
I would have never waked into this placE without the reviews from Yelp and man am I glad I did. Great food served up in a shed. Will return.,0
"Pulled up to this location yesterday, and besides what YELP, and even the signs in the shopping center say, this location is no longer open, and has moved to Pebble/Green Valley. They will be open in late September.",0
Great quality selection. Wonderful customer service too :-) we definitely will return next year. Thanks deerbrooke farms,0
Beyond expectation\nNever had food deliverd where\nI needed to let food cool down\nBaked ravoli excellent garlic cheese bread\nExcellent! Will recommend to anyone and everyone! Thank you cafe Verdi.,0
The food is good but you need to demand your bills. breakdown of orders are somewhat vague. We just felt we are somewhat overcharged. I'm so hesitant to visit this restaurant even though it's near us.,0
Walgreens is Walgreens but it annoys me that their prices are higher here than at other stores. I understand that 4th and Fremont is a big tourist area but locals go there as well. It's just annoying.,0
The best of the Blueberry Hill restaurants in town. Counter service is reminiscent of diners in NJ.,0
Came for a quick cone before getting on the tram. It is what is to be expected from a small ice cream shop.,0
"I have been here many times for spring break with my family. It's a great hotel, very cozy, offers breakfast every morning which is great.",0
Solid 4 star American/Mexican food.  The take out drive through is super convenient on those busy nights.  My favorites are the rod burro and the borracho burro.    The tacos are good too.,0
Waitress was very friendly and provided great service.  Steak boxty was tasty and filling.  Went well with a pint of Harp.,0
I stopped in for a 6 inch club to bring to work. No wait- no complaints. I'll be back.,0
"Very disappointed with amount they assigned to goods was so shocked I literally did not refuse payment but went back to make sure they had given full credit,still don't believe they did check all items. Will never consign there again.",0
I had an appointment at 1030am. I am still waiting on answers from doc its almost 2pm.,0
This was our first visit. The French onion soup was fantastic definitely a recommend. The steaks were done just write and the wait staff was great,0
"Better than expected.. Good service, reasonable prices.. Awesome Nacho's, good Taco salad, sat at the bar.. It was fun watching them make the food..",0
"I don't see what the fuss is all about. The food isn't worth going here for, and every other bar in town serves the same beer.",0
Customer service was pretty rotten. Almost all the staff were rude and impatient and the whole experience was generally unpleasant. I won't fly this airline again-not voluntarily.,0
This place has a bigger dance room rather than other places.,0
Poor service. Don't care attitude. Food so so...,0
Way better than aiellos and mineos and everything else. I've lived in squirrel hill for 5 years and I can tell you that the delicious pizza smell making this neighborhood smell fantastic is coming from Napoli!,0
The Arizona Attorney General's office would be able to help us. File your complaint here.   https://www.azag.gov/complaints/consumer,0
"Visited Cabo for lunch on a business trip.  Nice presentation, but disappointing flavor.  I probably wouldn't go back...  I'm surprised that stay in business in the trendy NoDa district.",0
Yummy yummy carne asada fries!!!! Tacos were okay I like the guacamole it was fresh and had a lot of flavor. Not the fanciest taco places but definitely good for your taste buds!!,0
$2.63 for a small cup of coffee? With a side of attitude? I don't think so - too many other options in town. I think my love affair is over...,0
"relaxing, very good location.  little cramped with small tables",0
"Amazing habanero shrimp appetizer, awesome Southwest egg rolls, and the fish tacos were amazing. Next time I am Charlotte I will stop here.\n\nDid I mention the beer was pretty darned good too",0
Not too crazy about this place. I ordered a pastrami on rye and it was just a pile of meat on soggy bread.,0
Grade: C\n\nThe food is almost as good as the prices. Decent service.,0
Still serving cold burgers. \n\nThe chili is good though. \n\nThe cherry Dr Pepper hits the spot too.,0
Do NOT go here if you are looking for a nice 4 1/2 star place. Not very clean and very loud!,0
"Good, honest food, at a fair price, made by cheerful folk. I've been going there for years, and am rarely disappointed.",0
"It was decent for the price - it was cheap, but clean and quiet.  Travis at the front desk was quite helpful and understanding of our unique situation.",0
Visit this place almost weekly. Frequently enjoy happy hour with and crispy spicy tuna roll and chili ponzu yellowtail. Always reasonably priced and is good quality sushi. Have bad better have had worse but it's very good for the price.,0
"Came here for the flashlight tour which was very interesting, could have had some more wildlife out for people to see but very cool.  Don't come here during the middle of the day it's HOT!",0
"Dope food, dope queso. Ask for the secret spicy sauce if you like hot stuff. Great vibe and better food than the Chipotle down the street.",0
"I don't come here to eat much, I usually come for the beer cave. Best build-your-own six pack joint in the city!",0
"Excellent service, extremely professional staff  and excellent care. You leave the office feeling you have been treated by the best.",0
Take a downtown hotel. Move it to the South end of the strip. Fill with Hooters waitress rejects from six states. Offer $3 blackjack. Invite douchebags. Profit.,0
"We ordered the buffet, the food was not very good and almost cold. The waiter we had did not say a word to us after taking our drink order, overall I'd say to avoid the buffet it, it was a waste of money.",0
"Fantastic food, service and location.  What else could you want?",0
"The Tri-Tip was the best I've ever had, but the tuna was not good. \nGood, fast service.",0
BOTTOM LINE: I love the soup & sandwiches. I can bring my dog.,0
Two stars is being generous.  But at least I now have a place to go to if I want rude service and milky coffee drinks.,0
Does anyone remember when the Illini Union used to have a real cafeteria in the basement where the food court now is? They served some of the best comfort food available.  This was 20 years ago!,0
"Love this theater! The management team was great when I had a special request, couldn't ask for better customer service.",0
Employee here is abrasive even cursing at me.  Not your friendly local owned business. \nTh,0
Went there with two friends on a trip to Vegas and it was wonderful.  Atmosphere top notch. Staff was professional and friendly and prices reasonable.  Definite stop in vegas!,0
Donuts and coffee here are amazing! Fast friendly service! Cute little local bakery :),0
Pizza is good. But its over priced. We go here when our regular pizza place is closed.,0
"This place is simply amazing. The food is always so good, the staff is always very friendly and I have a blast whenever I head over there.",0
Not a huge fan. It wasn't super flavorful and I felt it was a bit too greasy. I think there are def. better options. I also saw this microwave as previously mentioned..?!?,0
This is a cute bar. Pretty small. Wish it attracted a younger crowd..felt really out of place.,0
Quality has gone way down and can't recommend this place anymore. Hiro Sushi is my new go-to.,0
Tuffy doesn't stand by their work and lies to their customers. Do NOT patronize this location.,0
This place is a JOKE!!!! From the pulled pork to the tri tip both NASTY!!! Got apple pie and it was damn near frozen!!! Service was nothing to desire!!,0
BoSa is better.\nI do like those preservatives pretending to be hash browns though. They're pretty solid.,0
Great bar food and atmosphere. I usually get the grilled buffalo chicken wrap. They have good beer specials and a unique crowd. Only problem I have is with the salad options.,0
Great little Starbucks with an awesome drive-thru that usually doesn't have a line. These baristas are always super friendly.,0
love the pho and spring rolls!!! the best vietonamese restaurant!! i,0
Got a ham from them for my employees and they just loved it so much they brought me some.  Plan on going back soon.,0
"The falafel is some of the best in Tempe.  The gyro sandwiches are cheap and solid. They have a gyro deluxe sandwich which comes with feta. Good times. Yes, the lemonade rocks too.",0
"Room was big and standard. Not many towels but enough. No refrigerator. The food was meh, and drinks expensive. Girls were alright, the casino didn't smell too bad.",0
Great value and casual diner experience. Love their pizzas! Be ok with young people or go somewhere else!!,0
This place is horrible!!! The staff is very rude and they don't have respect for there patients. The doctors are also not friendly!!! Office is VERYdirty!! Wouldn't recommend this place!,0
New owners took over.  The pizza sucks now!,0
"Love this place. Not the fanciest looking joint, but it has the best Mexican food I've ever had! Well done!",0
"YES, I appreciate the undying love and dedication to In-N-Out Burger.  I just don't get it.  To me, the burger tasted like a somewhat better \""Big Mac.\""",0
"Boarded my dog there and the staff was nothing but extra nice and caring. Price was unbeliveable, and they made sure we knew the dog was in good hands. Good experience.",0
Fun local neighborhood place to go. Old school Italian! Friendly staff with character!! Great pasta and fish special!  Italian wedding soup super per my 11 yr old. BYOB great too!,0
very disappointed that the Thursday nite classes have been cancelled.  i miss Carmen.,0
I went for a baby shower and they served appetizers.  Everything was very good. The guac was nice and fresh with not too much onion.  We also had good service that kept our iced teas filled.,0
"Very large thrift store, worth a look.  Definitely a lot of garbage that no one will ever buy, but there are finds if you dig around.",0
good pizza and large wine list...  I like it since it is off the beaten path in Old Town...\n\ni agree that it is a nice group place... they also have a pretty nice outdoor area.,0
"resort? not really, this an old hotel with very thin walls. rooms are outdated. this was my first and last stay at this place.",0
"Great selection of model home furniture.  Arranged in very fashionable settings.  Pieces to match any budget, I only with my budget was bigger..",0
Did not enjoy living here.  A very badly designed residential complex.,0
"Great location, nice atmosphere, good food. But very slow service, and overpriced. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with no meat --  it took 20 minutes and cost $6.75.",0
This place was excellent!! love the pools... you could swim anytime not limits. The wings are 25 cents 12 a.m.-6.p.m and $1.50 bud lights!! room view was of the pool... excellent!!!,0
Dr & staff are very friendly & knowledgeable. Office is very clean & they offer extensive services! Highly recommended!,0
"Great beers, great atmosphere, great service.  Just a great place, did I mention this place was pretty great?",0
"Fantastic customer service :)\n\nI said vegetarian sandwich, and he automatically got new gloves and a new knife for me. Actually help me to the beginning to end.",0
"The buses are filthy, but it's cheap. That's the only reason why I'm giving it a high rating. It's great from coming down from NAU.",0
"Food is incredible, good pricing. No reservations unless you have 8 people but its impossible to get a table for 7 in the evening. Also, the valet only parking is dumb.",0
The lackluster way they let a person to save all the front rows for here I in-laws when there were handicap people like me who needed it. And yes I payed the $5 to post this from my plain,0
"The food here is awesome. I always get the half chicken. If you get corn tortillas it's a healthy delicious lunch. Remember, it's cash only.",0
"Front desk was helpful and polite, with bright smiles. Rooms were fun because of the historical aspect, as well as the pictures and newspaper articles posted around the hotel. Clean, too :)",0
Very reasonable prices coupled with extremely thorough and professional service. My go-to barber shop.,0
"The room was not clean.  The hotel manager was extremely rude and aggressive.  \n\nSimply put, don't stay here.  For the same money, you can do a lot better.",0
"First rate. Stable Bar Tap is casual fun with good food. Take the underground tunnel to the \""House\"" for more serious upscale dinning. Quivey's is a wonderful experience.",0
"In regards to Cassie or \""Ricks\"" comment. I tried multiple times to get in touch with someone in upper management about my experience. It's funny how a review on social media suddenly makes this important...Too little to late.",0
The service was great but the cheesecake was par.,0
"Love this place. Have been going there for 13 years.  Everything tastes so authentic.  Went there last night, and the line was out the door.  Always good.",0
Absolutely the best Rueben I've had anywhere - and I eat the Rueben almost every time it's on anyone's menu.  Nice array of draught beers.  The place is also very reasonably priced.,0
"Food was just awesome; and Scott our host/waiter was the best ever, never an empty drink and great personality. We had the meatballs, pizza and chicken Parm hoagies. We just LOVED being there!",0
This place is good for pizza or pricey salads. The salads are really tasty though. Just don't order the stuffed pizza they are all cheese and very heavy and gross.,0
Marlin tacos...wow!  Shrimp diablo was phenomenal.   Great drink specials during the week.,0
the food was delicious!!! drove all the way from casa grande just to eat here!! service was great!!! our waitress was prompt and met all our food needs!! will definitely come back!!!,0
am a retired chef the stuff i used to trim or throw away is what they served!\nwe are a group of  men on way to airport\ni think maybe they served us crappy food because we looked like tourists,0
9:20pm and chair's all up on tables. Had to stand outside!,0
This place is expensive and not good.\nI wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for Italian food.\nI would suggest taking your hard earned cash elsewhere. Even Maggiano's across the street has better food.,0
"I came here for the Italian Beef Sandwich. The Flavor and Taste was excellent. If this is something you crave from Chi Town, you wont go wrong. I have not tried the Pizza yet.",0
"Best damn salad I've ever had in my life. Based on that alone, I give Houston's 4 stars. Perhaps someday I'll venture back to sample their dinner menu.",0
This is heaven for steak lovers like me! High quality and moody...I enjoyed my time very well.,0
"Sorry, the famous ribs were short on meat and overcooked. The deli slaw was soaked in vinegar.",0
"The restrooms looked like after an bombardment, an improvised shack amid buckets of olives and spices. Highly questionable hygiene for a food store!Disgusting. I will not go back until they clean up the place. It's just filthy!!!",0
The Loubie Bzeit appetizer and the Hommos Pocket are both very delicious. Definitely recommend for vegetarians.,0
i don't understand why this place always gets such good reviews everywhere. i guess the fact that it's not panda express or pei wei gets it some bonus points but honestly the food isn't that great.,0
Great guys. Good prices on tires. No BS. This is the place to get tires if you live in Lawrenceville Bloomfield area.,0
Pretty good bagels for Arizona.  Definitely remind me of New York bagels.,0
Fantastic! We tried this place based on yelp and tripadvisor reviews and all the great reviews were right!\n\nThe service is outstanding and the food is awesome. We will be back:-),0
Great place for a simple bagel and cream cheese or yummy lunch sandwich! Great food!,0
Went to go see the Grand Canyon IMAX show.  It was so good!  3D and everything.  I keep telling all my friends to go check it out!,0
"Well, here it is -- July 27th and they still are slow rolling me on my insurance claim.  What a crappy company.",0
Great food that really touches the soul. Love the fried chicken with their hot sauce. The waffles are excellent. Must order the fried okra and cheese grits.,0
Great location in the old Hungry Fisherman restaurant on the water on Lake Wylie. Lousy food.,0
It's a local bar.\nFun.\nNon pretentious.\nGood times.,0
"Very typical Starbucks, but with some very comfy leather chairs. Clean environment with friendly staff.  On par with the better Starbucks locations.",0
Breakfast at 2:30....  Holla!,0
"This store has such bad service. The service staff are rude rude rude.  Save your money, shop elsewhere.",0
My daughter came here for swim plugs and she really thought it was fun to get them made.  I came for fitted ear plugs and I also had a good experience.,0
Are u kidding me $53 for a mediocre meal!!!!! That was nothing short of robbery. Dot get me wrong the interior design was great I just wish the food was good also!!!!!!!!!,0
Quick delivery and cannot stress enough to register for email deals because i never pay full price.  Savings up to 50% off regular price!,0
"Good diner food, great people.  We love this place!",0
I like fast Mexican food and out of all the corner taco shops this has been by far my favorite..  Always fresh and hot off the grill/fryer it's one that I frequent regularly :),0
I've been sitting in the ER waiting room for 3 hours with my 85 year old grandmother who is having chest pains. Unacceptable!,0
Spinning.  Hardcore.  That about sums it up.  Give it a try if you want a workout that will totally kick your ass and leave you crying.,0
The nurses in the ER were amazingly kind and friendly. Made being there much more tolerable. There were so many screaming children running around. Handle your kids people. That is not okay.,0
"A single star? You bet and that's only because these folks have something at at least resembles bagels, and they're overpriced at that. Go to the Bagel Cafe, which has real ones.",0
"So mad when I got home to find out I paid 14 dollars for a box filled with dried batter, and missing cole slaw. If you like that stuff, then this is the place for you. Incompetent workers...",0
"Great food and friendly staff. A perfect neighborhood establishment, lots of regulars, but certainly not uncomfortable. Great place to watch a game. Very reasonably priced. I only took a star away because the beer selection is pretty weak compared to its competitors.",0
The 20 minute wait here to get a car is outrageous! The other companies don't look as bad as this one.,0
"Great spot. Alex always does a great job cleaning me up, quick, clean, and professional. If you make an appointment they are always ready right away. If you don't, they are busy so be prepared to wait.",0
"Good beer, Wednesday night is banjo night which always draws a crowd. Definitely a hipster bar. Food is fresh & worth trying. Get a dish that includes the house humus.",0
"Tried the stir fry crispy beef and the spicy island chicken. The beef reminds of Peking beef drenched in sweet spicy sauce. The chicken tastes horrible, dry and flavorless. I wouldn't even call this real Chinese food",0
What a great meal. Loved the authentic dress of the wait staff. Very friendly and the food was amazing!,0
They never answered their phone.\nMaybe they're out of business?,0
"Good, typical diner-style food. Breakfast is served hot, fresh, and fast. Family-friendly and family-run. The decor is dated, but the restaurant is very clean. Service is fantastic.",0
Yay!!! This place is CLOSED! Now hopefully something worth while will take it's place!! Yay!!!!,0
This was so good and cant wait to come back best orange chicken ever with chow main noodles,0
Horrible sums this place up! Stale bread with stale toppings. I will not give them a second try.,0
Small hole in the wall place with great tasting custard creations. Great custard with variety of toppings. Ok service but be prepared with cash. No credit cards taken :/ still good to stop n visit.,0
Not too shabby lunch deals. NOT DOS GRINGOS ANYMORE.  NOW CALLED ROCKY POINT CANTINA. I dug it. $2 coronas and tacos. looks really cool inside.,0
I had both of my card spray painted and they worked with my insurance to fix both cars with no cost to me. It took a little longer than I would've liked but they did good work.,0
Sooo blacked out here that\nWe heckled the guitarist.\nNot sorry. He sucked.,0
"Good vegan split pea soup, prices a bit high for what you receive though.",0
"BWW has maintained its standard over the years I've been with them.  Classic sports bar look with great friendly service.  Although the kitchen messed up our order, but Tyler made a speedy recovery and provided excellent customer service.",0
"Simply the best! His \""hungarian fire bread\"" is seriously addictive. Generous portions - authentic flavor and aesthetics - and goid story telling!",0
"I've been waiting for 15 minutes for the store to open and still nobody has shown up. The hours posted say 9am, and it is now well after 9.",0
Would not recommend. The food was sub par and not that reasonable $$. Service was okay but Joseph is just rude. Does not seem to care if he has repeat customers. Don't understand the previous reviews. Not our experience.,0
"Cool place. Very good ambiance for a date if you sit outside. Wine selection is good/fun, but not extraordinary. Food has always been pretty tasty.",0
The beer selection sucks and the little bit of food I have had here was unimpressive. BUT! A good place to people watch? And be watched? If you're into that.,0
"This place has everything for the perfect date. They had a guy singing called Big White Cloud? lol He was great, the service was perfect, the outdoor heaters are magical. I will be back!!!!",0
I like the food but felt it was a bit overpriced. Also I thought the portions were small however the quality of the food is great,0
"AJ & Vine made a good team and did an excellent job inside and out on our windows which included sun screens. No mess to clean up, very presentable workers and good communication. Thank you, Kerry",0
HOLY CRAP THEY GOT A COACH OUTLET.  Finally.  Maybe in another 10 years it will be on par with every other Outlet mall everywhere.  ;),0
I really didn't like the selections of gaming at this casino.  It was smokey that I walked out right away losing.,0
Great customer service! Love the view of the mountains on the patio. Good start to anyone's morning.,0
"Too much Spanish here. Employees are loud and obnoxious. I sat in my truck, couldn't listen to the constant bla bla any longer.",0
"This is one of my favorite places to buy food. It's so cheap but great quality, and the people are so nice!",0
"It's kind of divey but the buffalo wings are amazing, I recommend the good ol Irish experience",0
"Microwaved veggie burger. The place smelled like a wet kitchen floor...not a clean one, either.",0
"Staff can be slow and inattentive if you just come in by yourself. As always, food is cheap comfort food so if you're in the mood for that, you really can't complain.",0
I received a bouquet for my birthday on 9/23/14 and the flowers are beautiful today on the 29th.  Their flowers are the best and last the longest.  I love this store.,0
"Always good service, never much of a wait.  Other than that, it's Applebee's...you should already know what to expect.",0
Walmart on steroids... Customer service is a joke. I cancelled my Sam's membership because of the lack of customer service at this store! Sam's Club is fine as long as you don't ever have to interact with an employee.,0
Long waits and teenage workers with bad attitudes...nuff' said.,0
Great breakfast joint!! Friendly staff... Best pancakes I have found in the valley!!\nCool local art for sale on the walls.\nI dont mind making the drive from old town for this breakfast!!,0
"We always seem to have the Jack Daniels ribs. they are so good they melt in your mouth. We have had other items on the menu, but the ribs are to die for.....",0
I can never turn away a good carne asada burrito.  Their value meals are good and the portions are decent,0
"Beer are good and the atmosphere is excellent, a must see as it's in an old church converted into restaurant & brewery. I was not impressed with the food. The French onion soup was too salty, although the fries were pretty good.",0
"OK but would not choose it over other great restaurants in the area. Portions are good, but the food did not taste fresh the taquitos, were dripping from lard just not appealing.",0
Went in with my girlfriend  and she was looking to get a trim after waiting about 30 minutes they tell us they don't cut extensions...why didn't they tell us that before waiting 30 minutes.....? Ok...,0
This place was aweful!  The delivery was fast but the food was aweful.  I took 1 bite and it all went in the garbage!,0
Every time I've been here I always see multiple health code violations. The French fries are pretty good but the Reuben made me very ill.,0
Are you kidding me?? frozen bagels. I  rather go to the grocery store and pay way less for a frozen bagel. I am a fool thinking this place serves frozen food,0
"Great bar food, friendly staff, and good drinks. Their food is generally a generous portion for a great price.\n\nHappy hour is fair but not that great.  Good place to stop by for a quick meal.",0
I'm on a fan of the salad. I have been here twice and everything else is so so. Great wine list and place to start off to have cocktails before heading out.,0
"if you are looking for fresh veggies, look elsewhere, their selection is tiny and what they do have is in bad shape.  if you're looking for ingredients to make vietnamese or chinese dinners, then you're in luck",0
Gyros the way I like them. Delicious ingredients in ample proportions. Fresh pita.  Fast service.,0
"A \""quality\"" experience but it lacks intimacy, the service can be detached and the room nioisy. There are also too few good tables.",0
I love going here on Saturday morning... great donuts and super friendly staff!,0
"Went here this afternoon based on Yelp reviews.\n\nGot the philly steak with everything.  Are you kidding me?\n\nIt won't be in my dreams, and I won't be back.",0
Had a horrible experience with this company a few months ago. My story sounds very similar to the ones posted on here already. Incredibly lousy customer service and an owner who could give a damn about filling orders and delivering service.,0
"Went for brunch.  Had an omelette.  Food was good, but just good.  Nothing to write home about.  Atmosphere is cool.",0
"Good Southwestern food: Addictive chips, efficient service.",0
Big fan of their salsa.  The Pollo Diablito is my favorite here.,0
FYI Southwest Airlines won't let you print out your borading pass on your return flight until you arrive at the departing airport. Absolutely makes no sense....Will be using another airline for my travels.,0
If you eat-in it is amazing here! Easily 4 or 5 stars. But when you order delivery the food and service get lousy! So spare yourself the heartache and disappointment and eat in!,0
"Small portions. Over priced food. Very small menu (dinner). Was OK, but disappointing overall.",0
"A place for ultra-cool hipsters.. might as well sell PBR.\n\nSadly some people don't know what clothing should be bought or sold for, so this place seems like a great find..",0
"I wouldn't trust them to change my bicycle tire.  Very manipulative in trying to claim alignment is bad, need new air filter even though it was just changed a week ago.  Never coming here again!",0
Waiter was awful and food (pad thai) was not much better. Apparently letting the waiter know that your soda is flat (twice) is a huge inconvenience to him.,0
"I like the food don't take me wrong is just the price, quantity n quality of the food don't seem to be equal, but nice place to have some fun with friends and family...",0
"This is one of the better malls in this area. They have a variety of stores for men, women, and kids. However, I'm from California so I'm used to much bigger malls with better stores.",0
Horrible service.  Rude individuals.  They locked the doors before the business was closed so they wouldn't have to deal with complaints!,0
Just above bar food but fine in a pinch.,0
"Good sushi.  They have 4 different seating options: Booth, Sushi Bar, Grillside & Shoes Off Floor.  Decent sushi at decent prices.",0
Sesame Inn has 4 locations. Station Square is the worst of all. I generally avoid this one but love the other 3. Still much better than most Chinese around town.,0
Came here recently and just wanted to update that their beef bowl has gotten a little yucky. Still won't stop me from coming here though!,0
"I love this store! The people are friendly and the selections are very good. Sometimes... just a few items that I can't find, but otherwise FANTASTIC and very close to home.",0
I actually came her for a drug rep dinner and I must say the food was amazing. I had the steak and it was utterly delicious. Topped off with the chocolate cake for dessert = perfect. I will definitely be returning.,0
"I love pizza but didnt like howthe edges of the deep dish were so hard :(next time will order thin crust, sauce is really good here:)",0
Better than average BDubs here.  Service is good and beer is nice and cold.,0
"3 months, 22 emails, 10 plus calls and (I think) we have the final refund from Budget! \nStay clear of Budget Rental they DO NOT care about customers or resolving their monumental mistakes!",0
"This place is a staple for when my preschooler needs to let out some energy and we're all hungry. Food is always fresh, service is always outstanding.",0
"This was a great dining experience!  I enjoyed everything about this restaurant.  Very nice outdoor seating in a quiet location, great food and good service.  Can't wait to go back!",0
"Amazing food, amazing service, and amazing atmosphere!  Highly recommend the green chili cheeseburger, the green chili mashed potatoes, and the crab stuffed peppers were to die for!  Will definitely be eating here A lot!!!",0
safe place for sushi.  great service.  \n\nI saw the sushi chef making this cool boat platter with lots of sushi on it.  I want that next time!,0
"My car looks great, and all of the employees were very friendly.  I opted for the $24.99 full service car wash and used a $3 off coupon from their website. I will definitely return to this location!",0
This place is great. Never a bad experience here. Consistent good food and consistent good service. A great go-to breakfast spot.,0
"Went here again on 3/28/2011 before heading to a movie.  So far, so good. Consistantly good burgers, drinks and service.  Won't go wrong with this place.",0
Hnnngffff their signature spinach pizza\nIt's the only thing I've ever ordered there\nAnd it alone warrants 5 stars.,0
allways go in the morning! order a drink get free breakfast.....  9-12,0
"I have always had good service here. I had placed a catering order that somehow they lost, and they were able to turn the order around in less than 20 minutes the morning that I showed up to pick up the food. AMAZING!!!!!",0
Took two and a half hours to get our food. All our food was the thrown together in the same pan. Not worth the $55.,0
The best nail spa in Gilbert by far. They also have mini pedi's and mani's which are a lot cheaper but almost the same exact thing as the regular manis and pedis.,0
Amazing honey hot wings! Not easy to eat when the restaraunt is just as hot as the wings.... miserable! Not sure if it was the volume of people present or if the A/C was down. Ick.,0
Thai crunch salad is pretty good and the artichoke dip is pretty good as well. Give them a try if your in the neighborhood.,0
"I enjoyed this place for the most part. Good food. Ghetto area, but the food is good.",0
The service here was outstanding with a very friendly staff. I could not believe the amount of food we got for $7 per plate. Great food. Great prices. A new Pittsburgh favorite of mine.,0
"As far as Michaels stores go, this place is awful. The floors are dirty and cluttered and the staff is very loud, like yelling across the store loud. I felt gross being here, go to Hobby Lobby instead.",0
I visited this place twice and both times the woman at the register was rude. The food isn't that great and the chicken is cut in very small pieces.,0
"Enjoyed a stay-cation, the suite is awesome. Full size refrigerator, 2 person jacuzzi, and the balcony made the weekend amazing.",0
Pizza is served California Pizza Kitchen-style. Some people play pool during lunch. Don't play pool unless you're at Brother's.,0
This place has great pizza but they have no respect for Giants spring training fans. So save your money and go to Oregano's where they are not pretentious.,0
"HONEST!\n\nIf you are looking for honest, customer oriented service, this is the place!",0
"Looking over my credit card statement, I see they charged me more than I signed for. Guess I didn't leave a big enough tip.",0
"This place is good for breakfast, lunch, happy hour and dinner. If you're in Cave Creek AZ and looking for a casual place for good food and cold drinks, I recommend this place.",0
"A bit awkward. Kind of like the snack bar at a summer camp. Very nice people in there and the drinks were good. Decor was lacking, but I cant fault it much for that.",0
Best meatball sandwich! Rivals my mommas. Worth it!,0
They carry some good mountain and BMX bikes. I don't ride road bikes so I can't tell you much about the selection of those. Last time I was in the mechanics seemed a little young but overall I have had good experiences here.,0
Checked this place out while on vacation. They had pretty decent food but the atmosphere was very chain restaurant like. But great beer!,0
"Good location, always great service to get me in and out with my cup of coffee.",0
The food was awful.  The salad bar had wilted lettuce. The steak had absolutely no taste. There is a Texas Roadhouse around the corner. Go there!,0
"Just wanted a trim, got a quick perfunctory cut.  Grumpy hairdresser.",0
"The hostess are terrible and need to work on their customer service skills, our waitress did the bare minimum and the food left something to be desired. This is the second bad experience at this location. I will not be coming back",0
I was disappointed in my food tonight. The Tom Ka soup was sour with no spicy kick and the noodle dish was very bland.,0
"Asked sales associate if they match competitors prices and was told \""we don't have competitors\"". We told him if that's the case then we'll just go back over to your competitor and buy from them.",0
It was way to cold in there. Nose was frozen. Need a winter cold or you would freeze. Theater was clean and spacious.,0
Coffee was okay. Not all that fresh.  Service was also average. I think this place prides itself on being a vegan-friendly hemp coffee shop more than they pride themselves on serving good coffee.,0
"Just had my bike tuned up, paid $45, and the tires are almost flat.  Seems like they should check the tires for a tune up, its not like they have to change the spark plugs.  Don't go here!",0
Love the princess market! The food is good in the restaurant but I mostly go for the market. Very cheap food! Their prices are amazing and they sell halal meat.,0
Haven't had burger King for years and they have hands down the best eggs for a fast food.,0
Great food!!!  Live music.  I have lived here since 1996 and this is my first time!  Can't believe what I have been missing!!!,0
cheapskates set their a/c at 80 degrees. this is az. we can't enjoy anything with a/c at full blast.,0
Very good food and service. A great place to watch sports!,0
I would give no stars if allowed. Betty at checkout was extremely rude and abrasive. However manager working at the rear of store was helpful and gets the star here.,0
Terrible service. Mediocre Teppanyaki & for $20+ a plate.... I'd rather eat Panda Express.,0
I'd rather drive to c3 or castle Shannon to hit the drive threw. Fast food isn't fast when u have to walk in. Desperately needs a remodel.,0
"Poor service, with worse food. The only draw is obvious from the name of the restaurant. But that is why we have the internet.",0
Always fantastic food. well priced and quick service. Tasty!,0
"About $8 a sandwich.  A little out of the way.  The philly cheese steak was good.  As always, I threw in peppers.  Yum.",0
"A sagat award restaurant, and deserves it! Love this place, every time I am in town. I'll try and stop by, located in Sam's Town. It's worth it!!",0
Horrible service and food. Not what Dave Thomas created or expected.,0
20 damn minutes waiting for lumber to be cut. So employee finally meanders over and grabs the good looking lady's lumber to cut first who just arrived. Now I get attitude. Grrr.,0
Pete has been my dad's barber for over a decade. I make the trip here just to see him.,0
Love their Bobby sandwich! Have to stop here everytime we visit. So yummy!,0
Beautiful resort!  They did a great job with the dance competition.,0
Disappointing.  The bbq pork was off.  Veggies for the soup - no so fresh.  1st miss in a number of visits.,0
Don't waste your money this was the worst Chinese I've ever had.  Absolutely bland flavorless food I think they keep there costs down be removing all the ingredients from there dishes.,0
Fresh bagels and donuts first thing in the morning!!! And cheaper than any other place.,0
Perfect example of why this countries judicial system is a joke. These lawyers are a fine example of corruption as they make their money off of honest home owners and crooked HOA's. I suggest an honest lawyer look into their records and sue them.,0
My guests and I had a pleasant meal with good service.,0
Just had dinner here with the family and the food was good but the service was amazing and it takes a lot for me to say that. If you go sit in James section he is fabulous and I will be back just for him.,0
Not worth potentially getting robbed for. Our wings were fried pretty hard and the sauce was kinda nasty.,0
"One of the better pool halls around, full bar, lots of pool tables, medium sized outside patio with heating lamps in the winter, and Guinness on tap.",0
Average sushi place for above average prices. I suppose it's worth going to during reverse happy hour. Eh.,0
"Sure miss our Rubios in Surprise but this is a nice treat near the movie theater on Deer Valley! Food is solid, staff was friendly, salsa was yum as always. Can always count on Rubios for consistent food.",0
Mediocre mexican food! Delicious but not outstanding. Crispy taquitos. Fresh tamales. And crunchy chimichangas! Try their Baja dip!,0
Horrible experience. Make sure and read everything because they will lie to you about what you are signing in order to make some extra money.,0
"If you are returning home or new to PHX, good luck figuring out where to park or how to get back to your car.  Just not a very well thought out airport.",0
Loved the catfish and fried shrimp.  Mac & cheese was like that from the family reunion - so good!,0
"A required stop on every visit to the Strip. Best selection of Pasta, cheeses and meats. Try the Antipasto salad at the Olive bar. It's the best!",0
"Overall mediocre. Decent sushi, average prices. Went one time..idk if I'd go back",0
This was our first time staying here and were very pleased. The staff was really friendly and our room was spacious and very clean. The AM complimentary breakfast was also very good and once again a super friendly staff.,0
Best (Asian) Pastry in town!!! Sooo Yummy!,0
I was passing thru and saw a special on hotels.com. Hotel is very dingy! I felt so disgusted that I slept in my clothes and made an early exit. Never again!!,0
I like riding my bike there and their prices are less than a weekly market. I do wish they did not have anything from Mexico though. I am ok with avocados traveling from California but we do grow tomatoes here.,0
Ordered fettuccine Alfredo and the sauce was completely separated. It looked like butter and curdled cheese. I would not recommend this place.,0
Girl running the register was dumber then a sandpaper tampon.\nAll I'm saying,0
This place is terrible.  \n\nAwful beer selection.  Nice enough (if not braindead) servers.  Nauseating clientele.  \n\nWon't be going back.,0
"If you want a nice view go, but if your looking for good service and food go somewhere else.  The price for that kind if service is not worth it.",0
Really cool and fun experience! Lots of dif choices of healthy delicious food and cookies! The wings are awesome and I love their teas.,0
Very informative. Lots of info by a very knowledgeable tour guide...presented in a fun way.,0
"Nice hotel, somewhat fading with its decor and amenities like the pool and tennis court. Beware the fee and tax added at checkin that no one tells you about! Also great location in the heart of tempes downtown",0
"This place is overrated. My taco shell was so greasy, I ordered a taco salad with shredded beef and got big giant hunks of beef. One time was enough for me, won't be back",0
Great food! Great Price!  Great atmosphere!  Love this place. \nWhat a real steak house should be!  Probably the best Prime Rib I have ever had...,0
"Southwest Airlines...You will always be my first choice in air travel! I flew with another airline to use up an existing ticket...but whenever possible, I'm sticking with Southwest!",0
Very greasy and food tastes like it was not fresh and prepared and frozen.  Bbq meat tasted old.,0
One of the best in the city.  BUT!!!!  DO NOT GO THERE IN A CAB!!!!   They will charge you up the arse!,0
"Went here with my girlfriend. We both agreed it was good not great. Food is about what you'd expect from a central Illinois Italian restaurant. The atmosphere is a bit dark and dated, but the staff was very friendly.",0
"Cool place. Totally dig the neighborhood pub vibe. \nUnfortunately, the service is absolutely awful. The bartenders and waitresses are pretty rude and generally pretend like they didn't hear you when you've asked them three times for the same thing",0
"Food was very good for a sleepy little AZ town, this was impressive.  The salsa tasted extremely fresh and my wife said she wanted to get chips and salsa to go for a snack on our trip to Vegas.",0
Love this place! They grill the burgers in front of you over an open flame! I got the bacon cheese burger with extra pepper jack cheese and mushrooms! Awesome!!!,0
Terrible pizza! We ordered the monster pizza and it was literally a preheated pepperoni and cheese with all of the works added afterward and reheated. Very disappointed!!!!!,0
"Good for a breakfast with little kids, but otherwise not worth going to.",0
I love Cielo! No other salon in Vegas / Henderson has ever done as good of a job on my hair. Penny is the best! The salon always has great specials on spa services too.,0
Great place! Our favorite item by far is the crispy Thai tofu (and I'm not a vegetarian). The sauce is awesome and the tofu is firm and crispy. They're like mini French toasts.,0
"We used to love this place. Unfortunately tonight, we had the absolute worst service ever. We will not be returning.",0
YUMMY BREAKFAST/BRUNCH place to eat at! Great service too! Definitely would recommend to anyone.,0
Love the food here. So far everything I've tried has been good. Inside the restaurant could use some improvement. Whenever I eat from here I take it home because I don't like the inside but the food is great.,0
"The environment was very untraditional since its a vacated church. The food options were a good reflection of what's popular in Pittsburgh. I ordered the Pot Pie, which was good. However, I wasn't particularly impressed with the food.",0
"Spring Harbor has changed direction since my previous review.  Dr sondel was my reason for being there.  He is gone.  Not a bad place, but not the best anymore.",0
"Good chips and salsa, food average. Service good. Extremely busy on fri and sat notes.",0
Love this place. Jock looks good although he may give the groomers a hard time because of a broken jaw. They take good care of him,0
The food came out quick. I recommend the chicken quesadilla plate.,0
"The wings are great! I prefer the hot wings.\n\nThe rest of the menu varies. Sometimes their burgers are really good, but it seems it changes sometimes..\n\nThe wings are always good, though.",0
gross. This place is widely known as the toilet of all strip clubs.,0
"Not really a fan, but it is always crowded, so I might be in the minority here.  Drinks are super cheap and it is about 5 minutes from my house, so I might come back, but probably not.",0
"Five star service and friendliness rating for our server, Kiely(?). Poor wines selection to qualify this place as a wine bar. Forget about it.",0
Best mexican food by far in las Vegas. I love their veggie burrito and when ate mat the chimichanga couldn't be messed with. the food is sloppy yet organized and the portions could feed a lumberjack.,0
"Run down rooms, smoky Casino. Very few Black Jack tables. Last two times staying here on business they have tried to over charge on the daily resort fee. Always check your bill here. Very isolated property.",0
Rick Orr florist is closed. He apparently retired last year. The phone is being answered by another florist.,0
Their greek chicken pita is my favorite lunch dish.  And you need to add some of their house vinegar & oil.,0
Had chicken katsu and gyota. Every dish was horribly sour tasting.,0
Grade: C-\n\nI hate Applebee's. It only tasted good because I'm on a diet.,0
Great church with loving people!  If you're in the area and you want to grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ you definitely need to stop in!,0
This Starbucks is one of the more ornate locations that I have visited.  I enjoying the decor with the crystal chandeliers and all but besides the furniture there is nothing else remarkable to report about this location.,0
"Food was bad.  Charges for rice.  Service was meh.  Ordered fried chicken wings.  It came out soggy, nasty, and bloody--was utterly disgusting.  Would not recommend, ever...",0
I enjoy the convenience of a 24 hour pho place. Service is always okay but the food has never disappointed me.,0
Ehhh. It just serves its niche clientele. if you are older and are accustomed to that style of food and service go and enjoy. Do not expect too much,0
More outlets now. Still mediocre espresso/coffee.,0
"I really like the pizza and they deliver! It's a nice thin greasy style pizza. The toppings are a little scarce, but the price is good. Don't order sausage.",0
Great service and great times!! Nothing like beer and bowling. I will return and look forward to the live DJ.,0
"Yum. Great cherry limeade and banana shake. Tater tots were super hot, which I love. Service was quick and friendly.",0
"Just an update, called to make reservations for a client lunch, was informed as they no longer have a kitchen, they no longer take reservations.  FYI. Gave three stars b/c I haven't been.",0
Manager corrected issues noted in last review..very satisfied...will recommend this BK,0
"This location is the closest store to me now that the one in the Chandler mall closed. It is ok, I guess. The one in the Tempe Marketplace seems to get more merchandise and is better staffed (I guess because its bigger).",0
Waited forever. Ended up leaving to get food sooner. They should not tell people the wait will be 20 minutes when it is over an hour.,0
"The service is fast and friendly. Good size portions. Each time i have had their food i have enjoyed everything. Its not the best Chinese food if all time, but its good food for a good price.",0
Worst Chinese food I have ever eaten.  Going back to Wan Fu which has been great for 20 years.,0
I am a fan.  Bread is fresh baked.  Breakfast sandwich rocked my socks off.  Small place in industrial area.  Well worth a visit.,0
My kids love going to the dentist! They remind me when it been 6mo. We love Dr. Quackenbush and his staff!!!,0
Very very large  beer selection bottled and draft.  Bartender was great with explaining the beers they have. Great prices on happy hour with a good food selection.  Try a different wild game burger if you're adventurous!,0
"Cheap booze, diverse crowd, great bartenders, rad KJ, best karaoke bar in town. N'uff said.",0
The WORST customer service experience I have ever had.\n They have no courtesy or manners what so ever.,0
"5/5! Excellent service, professional nail care, & welcoming environment all with a Spa-like feel. I have finally found a home for my nails... :)",0
"Two employees from there were extremely rude (bri & Bree) as soon as I left they huddled up to talk about whatever it, it seemed like their customers bothered whatever it was they were doing... Never giving them my service again!!!",0
It's an airport with sand sculpture animals. Oh and slot machines you know for when you can't wait to get to the casino and want to throw your money away first thing :),0
Fried pork chop and steamed chicken with green onions and soy sauce. But the waiters are idiots!,0
Watch the signs for rental car return it is a little confusing.Took me 40 minutes to get from Hyatt place airport to rental car returns.,0
"Our family loves this place.  Friendly, well run and good with kids.",0
"This store is a dump with a mediocre selection of overpriced antiques and trinkets - most of which are entirely forgettable. Additionally, the woman who was working there is extremely rude.",0
"Good, cheap diner food. They have all the diner classics served whatever time of day you crave them aaaand they have a bar.",0
This place is overpriced and isn't real Italian. I was shocked by all the 4 and 5 star reviews of Sutti Santi. Don't waste your time here.,0
Will not be doing any business with them if I can help it.  Was just cold called about their 'exciting plans' to my cell phone.,0
Okay I gave it another try for a friends birthday and I actually had a blast! It was a sunday and we had a table but it was a really good time. I'd go again with a group of friends :),0
Very intimate restaurant. Enjoyed the seven course meal with my wife. Highly recommend for a memorable experience on mt. Washington.,0
Play place under renovation. Bad wi-fi mojo.  Service should be a little better to keep the place worth coming to.,0
"The atmosphere is great and it is an excellent place to study.\n\nHowever, their drinks are not that great and very overpriced.",0
Any yelpers know where Sue is working now? She was amazing and she's left this place. I'll follow her if I know where to go?,0
"Definitely divey but whatever.  Its cheap, fast, good and open late.  No place for me to get gyu-don after 4am so this place works just fine.",0
"As usual, the hummus was tasty.  Tried the artichoke pasta salad which was decent and perfect for a hot day in PHX.",0
"Great service and even better soul food. Try the fried green tomatoes, Mac and cheese, collards, catfish and fried chicken.",0
Did the Thanksgiving buffet there.  Everything was fantastic,0
are u kidding me people 4 stars had the spicy chicken bowl 98 percent rice chicken not spicy and the tuna roll well........ the tuna piece was so small all you could taste was rice i relize this place is cheap but thats because so is rice,0
"They handle the massive traffic quite well.  Free wifi, good selection of food, plenty of places to sit.\n\nStay away from their tight slot machines and be prepared to walk a bit to get to your gates.",0
This place is horrid! They are discriminatory and I will NEVER come back!!!! They are also horribly organized! FAIL!!,0
"The best part of this place is the wait staff. They make the place and it's a good thing because the food seems to be deteriorating with every visit. It is close to home, so I am hoping that they improve the food.",0
All excited about the tostadas. When I received them they were ice cold. The only reason for the three stars was the service was super friendly.,0
Pretty good selection of food and beer here. the burger i had was pretty good. the wait staff was pretty friendly. Overall a pretty good place,0
Lousy over zealous life grds.  Won't even let you float on your back.  Lifeguards are power monger idiots here!  I was a 10 year lifeguard and they are not trained or professional.,0
"Opted to try a noodle soup. Description did not include that shrimp was part of the soup. Sadly, not being able to eat shrimp, my entire to-go order was a waste. No happy belly on this trip.",0
Great beer specials but it's always over crowded and very noisy. It would be an awesome place if they could somehow do better crowd control. Pretty sure the fire marshal wouldn't be thrilled to see the sea of humanity within.,0
"Awful wings,  filthy tables. Good luck getting drink refills... and on a Monday night,  hate to be here on a busy night",0
"I prefer the layout of Petsmart. The staff is friendly and helpful, probably because no other customers were in the store. When I need to drop in to get some canned food for my dogs, the place is deserted.",0
Food is always good but service was poor at best today. 23 muni yes to take our lunch order..... And no more lunch specials!,0
"Checkin out their \""going out of business sale.\"" It's kind of messy in here....eek!  However, this is the most people I've seen in Borders at one time--that's pretty depressing!",0
Very happy with Scott's Pastry Shoppe.  I had a speciality - gag cake made up and they were terrific.  I have only had doughnuts and such and thought they were terrific.,0
I felt like I was bothering the employees here with my order. It took me making eye contact with three employees (one of whom was standing around) before anyone came over to take my order.,0
"Can't go wrong. A clean, modernized decor, and everything we ordered (beef and chicken pho, fresh spring roll) was above average.",0
"This  place was incredible!  For $20 I got a huge delicious prime rib with bread, side salad and baked potato.  We will definitely be going back to this place next time we are in Vegas!",0
it's in a bad location in Chandler. Long wait and the quality is not good. Place is dirty and stinky. Go to a different location.,0
"Melt-in-your-mouth food...and close to my office! Bring cash, though...no plastic!",0
"Great location downtown Charlotte, nice menu and wonderful Hand Crafted Beer Selection.\n\nSports bar atmosphere with quite a few TV's located around and a few Pool Tables too.",0
pretty cool club right by where i live staff could be nicer though,0
I got food poisoning here. It was the worst experience of my life. Don't eat the chicken!,0
Mediocre food.  Good service.  No need to return.,0
"here's a tip - they don't stock their shelves, so what's on display they might not have, and they often have discontinued items on display. lame.",0
Most every negative stereotype that exists as a part of lesser apartment living will be present here. 2 stars for nice front office staff,0
"I entered the place one afternoon.  The people working there were so f**king rude, that I had to leave!",0
Phoenix Flower Shop did a stellar job on our bridal flowers. Every item looked just  as I had described to the florist and we were even able to pick up a few loose stems at the last minute. Excellent!,0
Terribly slow service (especially drive through) and they're always running out of things.,0
Worst customer service I have ever experienced at an Arby's. Maybe they were having a bad day?\n\n\n\n\nFood was still good. Mountain Dew sucked though.,0
Tuesdays are the best obvs thanks to their special. Not really a dinner place but great place to hang out and have a variety of wine selections.,0
BEST WINGS EVER!!!!  Service is slow but it's worth it!  Burgers are good too but the wings are outstanding!,0
"My absolute favorite restaurant.  Flank steak sandwich, spinach dip, potato chips, and the tort.  I always want all of them and can never decide.  A must try.  And definitely sit on the patio!",0
40+ years in business at the same location can give you an idea how consistently fresh and delicious the food is. You won't be disappointed so go and try the whole menu!,0
"Super friendly! Went here to buy paint and magnets for my classroom.  There were lots of color options and many different shapes and strengths of magnets.  Also, if you are in the market for some good people watching, this place delivers!",0
This place is gross. It all tastes the same - greasy and disgusting.,0
"Clean taxi but these people are unreliable. 30 minutes late when I needed a cab ride to the airport. They already \""picked me up\"" without even calling to tell me the taxi was here. Poor service.",0
"Excellent customer service, quality work...very competitive pricing. I would recommend this place to anybody!",0
"Good times with family and friends.  In the Motel 6 where the kids stayed for the wedding, so very convenient.  Near great shopping.",0
"Had some shirts embroidered & silkscreened, took them less than 2 days for 8 shirts... not too bad! They came out really nice. I posted a pic under Tips & I'd recommend checking it out.",0
"After hearing how great Jimmy John's is, I decided to go in myself and see what all the fuss was about. To be honest the sandwich wasn't good. I gave them 2 stars for having good customer service and for being so quick.",0
"Steve could use some more CSR training. Decent PSL, clean bathrooms, good parking but focus definitely seemed to be on their drive thru and not the walk in customers.",0
The lady who runs the office is unpleasant and rude. Will not use this garage in the future.,0
The worst chinese food I've had. I got the General Tso's Chicken and it came dry and very not spicy at all when I asked for extra spicy. Panda Express is better.,0
"You can't go wrong with Pho Kim Long. Morning, noon, or all night! Quality food, fast service, and friendly environment.  Order anything. It'll be above average.",0
Amazing food!!! The southwest salad with Cajun steak is awesome!!! The bruschetta as well!!!! Servers are very nice and food and drink service is quick. Come here often and will always!,0
"This diner offers an unexpectedly large number of vegetarian options, including a fantastic \""Sheldon\"" sandwich--their veggie analog to the Rueben.  Fresh hot fries would have nudged this rating to five stars.",0
The food is okay but nothing to travel too far to experience.  The pizza was good.,0
"Sorry, this place doesn't get it. I went two years ago and it was ok but this week it was C- at best. The catfish was greasy and the oysters were soggy. Must have changed hands recently.",0
"Nice ambiance in the patio area behind, but the food is mediocre at best. Soggy and bland tacos. Very slow service and a bit uptight as well, like not enough help.",0
I finally tried their food and it was a good thing to do. Descent pizza and good selection of dessert!,0
"Had a little plaque that goes on a trophy. They wanted a dollar a letter. $57. 00 for a 2\"" by 1/2\"" plaque. Very unreasonable. I had the plaque to boot",0
A serviceable breakfast choice bit a bit overpriced for what you get.  Denny's food at twice the price.  The breakfast buffet will cost you the same.,0
"Great down-home atmosphere with classic comfort food. Portions are enormous, and, as it's comfort food, can be heavy.",0
Have been here twice and its was just ok.,0
I finally made it over to My Florist for lunch.  I had the turkey and brie sandwich.  It was excellent.  The service was great.  I liked the space.  I will definitely go back.,0
Better than average Asian food for a take-out restaurant. Get their crab angels though. DELICIOUS!,0
Love going here.  Great atmosphere and great food and a dance floor.  Had a wedding reception here and it was on the outside patio in back....Was a lot of fun and cant wait to go back.,0
Orange chicken with Fried rice was good. Gang Pang beef was not large enough pieces of beef. But at 11pm it's a great late night place.,0
These have got to be the nicest public tennis courts I have ever seen!,0
"This place sucks, not good Mexican food. The Taco Bell I had the other day was more authentic.",0
I have done business with this company both for residential and for our businesses for about 30 years. They are absolutely top notch!  Very competitive prices but top quality!,0
Yummy authentic Mexican food with recipes that have been in the family for generations.  The flan is a must!,0
Pretty good if you don't mind the crowds and you know what you're looking for.,0
Here's an update! I just completed my second fitness challenge and won! Now down 110 pounds since January. Still loving the people and the place. Keep up the great work!,0
"I used to rate this 5 stars.  It was worth driving across town for.  Now, the scoops are much smaller and the flavor has changed.  Not worth the money, the calories or the drive!",0
Drinks were great. But...Damn their Seafood needs some change. I couldn't even finish the meal. First bad experience though. It may have just been a bad night.,0
"After a lazy, post 5k run Saturday I wanted a quick frozen treat.  Came here and got.....freezer burned ice cream.  \n\n\""Meh.\""",0
Pizza is ok pasta ok wings ok salads ok \nService sucked one of them was mean to my sis when she worked there but she doesn't anymore. Enjoy if your going,0
course was in good shape.the only problem i had was my 6 month old clubs fell off the cart 3 times and scratched some of them.didnt hurt my score.,0
Dine at Hugo's Cellar only if you are looking for the QUINTESSENTIAL Las Vegas experience!,0
I tried their rainbow roll few months ago. The fish is pretty much tasteless.,0
Piece of crap. Wish I can give it 0 stars but Yelp is forcing me to be nice. Terrible establishment with terrible values as a business. Anyone who gives them business should be ashamed. Never going back here again,0
From reading all of the positive reviews I wonder where all the wonderful service happened to be when I came in. Respect and Courtesy wasn't their strong suit on this beautiful Saturday.,0
Overall great customer service but a little upset about their Sig/ Sig accessories selection. Prices weren't bad at all. I will probably go back to get a better look at what they do have but I have yet to find anyone who stocks Sig magazines,0
Love this place.  The food was very good an the service was great an fast. Love the pastries too. Would have lunch with my mom a lot at the one in Ca. Will def be back.,0
The manual car wash is very expensive. I am going to do my car at home from now on. The price of the manual to do a good job approaches a full service wash with interior clean up.,0
Eh. Blase menu and food execution. Excellent location and pretty nice interior but atmosphere is sterile. \n\nMany better options in Charlotte.,0
"Good place to watch a sports game.  Beer specials were good. Food is very overpriced though.  The wings are about the worst I've ever had... and I've had alot of wings growing up in Buffalo, NY.",0
Overpaid dramatically for the terrible sandwich I received. Really bad sandwiches in this dump. I hate giving money to people who don't deserve it. Not good for the money. Not my thing. No sir I would not like another.,0
Room was pretty clean. Towels smelled bad. Could feel every spring in the bed and pillows were a joke. Whole place smelled of stale smoke. Gave it 2 stars since it was in a good area and sheets seemed clean.,0
This place was wonderful. $7.99 for lunch. Quick service. Friendly staff. Great food.,0
"Been through this airport twice now and haven't had any issues. Easy to navigate, indoor smoking areas and slots to while away the time if you are so inclined. Typical food choices and stores. It's an airport what do you expect?",0
This business is recommended by Discount Tire locations.  Good pricing and fast service.  They did such a good job on my alignment I was wondering if I had the right vehicle.,0
"I finally found a good vet, yay! Needed meds and a surgery on my dog and they were able to do a payment plan. Thank you for the help!",0
Yummmyyyyyyyyy truffles!,0
Our usual place for a car wash. Fast and easy...,0
Very diner like. Extensive menu and definitely something for everyone. Great service.  Good restaurant choice for the area for sure! Any place that roasts their own turkey and serves fresh mashed potatoes and gravy rates in my book.,0
This is my absolute favorite place to retreat into a romantic or just cozy getaway from the AZ heat and sun! Downstairs is a hidden gem.. food is eclectic and delish! You will thank me for this if you have not been!,0
"This restaurant was just okay to me.  I ordered a thin crust and it was just average.  The garlic cheese bread was the best part of the meal. It was tasty.  The staff was friendly, so that was a plus.",0
Still some of the great places but the prices went up. Not a bang for your buck anymore.,0
"Boba and food is good, but the service is terrible. Been going here for 4 years and it hasn't changed.",0
"When it comes to Hawaiian food, Ross J's is as good as it gets.",0
The waiter was weird & rude. No wonder many people pay more to eat at Asian restaurants in casinos rather than going to out to eat in Asian plazas.,0
I ordered fish. Friend had brisket. It was uninspiring. And not much food. And pricey for that little food.,0
Had a great Parmigiana sandwich and my friends also ate some chicken and other cold cut meat sandwiches.. great deli at great low prices!,0
Terrible service. Two days in a row they screwed up two different shipments. Not sure how they stay in business with such incompetence.,0
"Food, service and atmosphere were excellent. I don't ever post reviews but couldn't believe this place didn't have a higher rating.",0
"Cheap food, but everything fried on a Friday tastes like fish.  Probably not a big deal if you like fish taste, but I don't.",0
Chips and salsa are awesome! Drink specials are good! Would recommend ad a place to meet friends for drinks with chips and salsa!,0
New digs are nice!  Service was solid.  Food was solid.,0
Horrible management 30 minute waits on each hole because they cannot hire a starter who can do a mediocre job of managing a 27 hole course.,0
"Saw a great show here, fun chill vibe, and seems like they always have bands coming through. Drink prices are great. Feels a world away from Mill, and this in a very, very good way. :)",0
"I go to watch Grounded and Fred Green there. Drinks are decent and cold. One of those places you can't believe there's a cover charge. Like Mandi said, slumming without the risk.",0
I really like this particular Starbucks!\n\nStaff is very friendly and very efficient. \n\nVery busy store especially after 3:00 in the afternoon.,0
Can't go wrong with boiled peanuts. You gotta try the boiled peanuts!! This is where I go when I need my Korean fix. Awesome Kim Chi and Meat Jun. Fish Jun is Ono too.,0
Adding a star because you can order books online and pick them up here.  That makes up for the small selection.,0
Service was slow and dismissive. Food was excellent-the best waffles and pancakes.  Place needs a deep cleaning and training in customer service.,0
"It is April 30th at 10:35am. According to their website, their yelp page, their automated phone system and their front door this place is supposed to be open at 10am.... need I say more?!",0
"It was good but nothing spectacular. I ordered Pho noodles with beef and meat balls. Also, shrimp spring roll. The food came out really quick!",0
"Nice lunch menu...I cannot review for dinner, I haven't been back to this place for over 5 years....my most recent trip was for lunch, the menu is extensive and great pricing.",0
"Better than KFC and even Bojangles!  Friendly staff, fast service, cheap greasy goodness all around.  Bring cash.",0
"service was kinda slow, they stuck us in the back seemed kinda weird because the place was empty, seemed a little rascist. they forgot our silverware and salad and breadsticks took 20 minutes to arrive.",0
This place is terrible. The meat tasted like asshole.,0
"You would think for being in Vegas that this airport would be as the same as the strip.\nHas horrible areas to eat at while waiting for your flight and please, please turn on some air freaking humid...",0
Its not a very helpful place but It was clean. It feels old and outdated. I did manage to meet good people that helped me get to my location. For service Im okay if the place doesn't look good.,0
"I rent from National in Charlotte about once a month, and I'm consistently happy.  With Emerald Club, no lines at all, and there is always a good selection of cars (including hybrids).  Fast, friendly and efficient.",0
"The food and especially tortillas are amazing!  I would never eat at the location, but a quick pickup for lunch (during daylight!) is perfect.\n\nThey are always cops there EATING so you know its good!",0
This is a good lunch place...only been there twice and ordered a meatball sub both times but it was really good and too big for me to finish.  I'll definitely be back for that.,0
"The service at Mr. Roberts is okay, but the free live music is what pulls me in! Drinks are reasonably priced too.",0
"Good apps, bar service. Always good cuts of steak and good service.",0
"Trendy, but coffee leaves something to be desired. Location is good though and the decor is novel. Okay place, but way overhyped, I don't get it.",0
Had the chili releno and white corn tamale. Yummo! For a mainstream Mexican restaurant the food was good still good. Just a bit too pricey when you can get the same or better at other places.,0
"Great service, friendly staff, great food, great prices. What more can you ask for in a small town breakfast place? Will definitely be back",0
"If you want to be threaten this is the place to eat.  Horrible service, manager is extremely rude.",0
Carne asata wrap and a small pasta salad waiter was awesome and the food rocked!!!! Def would come back!!!,0
"Fast, friendly, cheap, and greasy. The perfect Mexican restaurant!\nI also love 99 cent chicken taco days!",0
"Avoid this place!  Rip off, rude, incompetent.  If you do go here, look around at how there's no one else in the shop, and the empty garage.  Turn around and leave before they touch your vehicle.",0
"No bathroom, uhhh what kind of gas station is this but however there are two redboxes.",0
Really cool rainbow lights when you drive down the freeway at the evening time. Parking seem to be really difficult unless you want to pay the price for VIP designs are really fast.,0
"Nice venue,  good food, great beer, awful service.  Staying at the Sheraton here I've patronized Bar Louie a dozen times recently and they screw up the order in some fashion every single time, without exception.",0
"First off, Brake shops are probably the biggest rip-off going. I bought all the parts here and changed them myself, saving over $100 bucks at least....",0
"The food is decent, not as good as before the move, but still good. They get bonus points for being open late, which is always a good thing.",0
"Pho is really all about the broth and these guys really hook it up. It's the first place I go when I've been out of town too long.  Good service, clean, and really good food.",0
"Walked in here on a pub crawl around Madison. Not impressed. The service was horrible, even at an almost empty bar. We finished our beer and moved on.",0
"Big tasty portions, homey feel, and great service!  We'll be back!",0

"Great store, great ife xream. My wife and i go here and its always worth the cost. Its also geat that they let me call in an order then pick it up for those quick stops on lunch break.",0
We sat at the bar to watch Kansas beat Ohio and were treated to a royal show by our rockstar bartender Aaron.  The food was so amazing we returned the next day for your last dinner together for our trip to Arizona.,0
Tasty burgers and onion rings. Clean and friendly. I'd go back again.,0
"What happened?  Poor service, loud rap music, so-so food and $9.00 glass of wine?  Wow, it must be the Mill Avenue curse.",0
"Seriously? This will pass for mexican food in Arizona? I have had better mexican food in Akron, OH.  Stay away from and find a street cart, seriously.  Nothing else to say but, yeck!",0
Clean and comfortable - very friendly and helpful staff. Had some special requests and they were great about it.,0
Great dive burger joint.  Really enjoyed the cowboy burger.  The fries are well seasoned and crispy too!,0
It's okay I don't have anything to say really the customer service is ok and the food is okay only had one bad experience where all of my tacos were crushed couldn't eat them with out a spoon it was horrible.,0
"Worst Chinese Dining ever, and on my Birthday too, customer service is rude & my appetizer was the last dish to get into the table... 1st and Last time here",0
"OK, the remodel of the gaming floor area is nice, but to close the shrimp bar was a complete slap in the face of history.  Dupars is too busy and expensive to make people feel comfortable just going for a shrimp cocktail.",0
The theater could use updated. Friendly staff and clean but they dont show all new releases and the theater is on the small side...love the location. I can dine and shop in the mall but they need a bigger theater to have longevity.,0
Used it for take-out on a recent trip to Scottsdale. I would say it is stereotypical red sauce and pasta food - nothing special.  The eggplant was overcooked and dry.,0
I called to get an idea on fixing a plumbing issue.  The person on the phone was very rude and short.  Needless to say I'll take my business elsewhere.,0
"This is a great place to grab a quick meal or pick up dinner or your way home.  It's fast, not too expensive, and the good tastes good.",0
My favorite place to get a coffee.  Nice and clean with delicious (if overpriced) desserts.,0
"Best. Food. Ever. But only open until 4:30pm! And not Sundays either. \n\nRegardless, the Akin's plate has to be one of the premiere bang-for-your-buck meals on State Street.",0
Thee worst BK I have ever been to!!\n\nThe burger was so over cooked that it tasted like the smell of cow manure!!... I couldn't even dare finish my burger.,0
Some of the worst donuts I ever had. Bland and stale. My wife and I walked out and left the donuts on the table after two bites. This was 2 years ago. Never been back.,0
Very disappointed!  \nThe food was poor quality and fair at best!\nDon't waste your time.,0
Great spot with great coffee. The staff is super friendly and helpful. I love their selection of baked goods too.  Looking forward to the new location next door because the bathrooms will new and updated!,0
They were too busy to take our take-out order! Too bad. But...I'm glad they're so busy they didn't miss us!,0
Ok so the atmosphere was good the service was good but the pollo fundido is probably the reason i will go back..That thing for 11 bucks...ya sign me up for 2.,0
"Great atmosphere, food and staff hidden in South Phoenix.  When friends come to visit this is the restaurant they all want to stop at.",0
"Mediocre food, slow service... My wife and I went to lunch and it took forever to get a cheeseburger and a salad.",0
"Elegance to the guilds.  Great food and awesome wine list.  This place is awesome for lunch, dinner, or just happy hour.",0
"Landmark is definitely a favorite place of mine the service is good the food is plentiful and the prices are low, it's not a super fancy place but a good old fashioned diner..",0
Never eating here again. I was sick for 2 days after I eat one of their burgers.,0
This place is great! Wonderful service and the best Chinese food in the Valley. Huge servings for great prices. Try the spring rolls and the teriyaki chicken! They're my favorite.,0
Like a motel with a golf course. Except you don't have to park 15 minutes away from your room at a motel. No room service no spa.,0
"Great for drinks - a haven in WI winter. \n\nThe food is not very good.  Some of the appetizers are okay, but the meals are overpriced and don't taste very good.",0
I Took the Yelper advice and ordered green chile burro enchilada style. It was good!,0
"THE Worst McDonald's I have ever experienced. Believe me, I'm a vet & have been to them all around the world too! Find another; it's easy enough to do.",0
"Ate her again and it is poor food, the service was reasonable.",0
Had a burger & fries the other day for lunch.  Great prices.\n\nPlenty of TVs & pool tables.,0
The pizza is FANTASTIC and I love the SALAD DRESSING!!!\n\nNello's has been a favorite for years and they never fail to deliever what has made them famous!!,0
"This place runs hot and cold. Some days the food is awesome, others its meh. Price isn't bad. Place could use renovation and someone dedicated to picking up the used dishes more often.",0
"They told me they could fix my car, but when they were done, they found more wrong with it.  A fifth grader could have done better.",0
"Flight took off 1.5 hours late. And it's southwest, so no food, just light snacks. Waiting 1.5 hours then taking a 5 hour flight without a meal does not render a positive Yelp review.",0
"Really nicely maintained location - doesn't smell like a \""pet store\"" like so many others and their outreach/adoption programs are great.",0
This Petco has really friendly staff. Their clearence bin is always full of good deals.,0
Some of the best coffee I've ever had -- and I lived in Portland. Insanely good selection & product. Tanzanian peaberry off the charts. Owner gets beans from multiple sources to ensure that his selection is the best.,0
"Horrible Experience!  Wrote a review yesterday, and somehow it was taken down. Do Not Shop Here!  Will keep posting Every Day if review is taken down. Terrible Service!",0
This location is not closed! I will write another review after visit later this evening!,0
So good!! never disappoints. especially when they are freshly made love the free samples!!,0
I used to really like this place but it seems the quality has dropped off. I picked up a to go order today and it reminded me why I had not eaten their food in almost a year.,0
"Had the mushroom swiss burger...always a goodie!! Totally greasy though, it ran down my arm, but was so good! Do I ever eat healthy?! haha",0
"Rude staff, run down interior, not the safest place in town.",0
Love taco bell chalupas. This particular location consistently smells really bad though.,0
Great place to eat inexpensive Chinese food and the wait staff are very friendly!,0
I have been here several times.  Food is always good and the service always sucks.,0
"Quite frankly, this place scares me. Always crowded with security and I always got pushed and shoved. Not my kind of club. Glad this place is closing.",0
Went there this past weekend and had Steak & Lobster. Really love the taste of the food and customer service was great.,0
"Good large selection of items.  Very nice, helpful folks.  However, the cheeky mouse that kept running out while we were checking out will insure that we only eat pre-packaged items.",0
Awesome brunch. One of the best in CLT. Sit outside and enjoy the NoDa scenery. Love the make-your-own Bloody Mary bar.,0
Always raising prices on us as well as the worst customer service over the phone... fighting with us about how they have the best everything and really they don't we are no longer customers with them!,0
"For $10 you can get an 8 inch sub and a GIANT slice of pizza. Needless to say, this has become my favorite place to order dinner from.",0
Great friendly service. Consistent food quality every time. It's nice to come back and see the same team working so well together. Always a pleasant experience!,0
"You can't beat the price for the quality. If you're looking for upscale and expensive, go to Scottsdale. Otherwise if you want downhome and good swing by Texaz. The Freidy's Filet is awesome!",0
"I love this place! I wish they had them in California.  I go here very time I'm in AZ at least 2-3 times.  The food is always great, the place is clean and the staff is awesome and kind.",0
"I loved this place before, but the new updates put it over the top!  Awesome decor, great menu, and as always, an incredible staff!",0
I was actually surprised with how good the service and Chinese chicken salad was at lunch. Far better than the CPKs back home in SoCal. Way to go Phx AZ!,0
veerrrrrryyyyyyyyy dirty. I think I will buy them some clorox wipes and light bulbs for their sign out front. I made 12 u-turns trying to find this place.,0
"Not bad,  not great. Nice atmosphere with kind and professional staff. Food? Typical bar food, nothing spectacular at all. Great place for older folks.",0
"I love this place, but the prices are a little higher than other breakfast places. The atmosphere is really nice.",0
"Usedto come here all the time in high school, but it has slowly become more and more ghetto. A decent mall, cheap stuff.",0
Delicious food. Great service. Interior not the best but they could of made it better by having Cuban music on or something.,0
Really needs a renovation. Stayed in 2007 and came back in 2011. Nothing has changed and I doubt it ever will.,0
they are less than a minute from home..\nthey have everything basically..\nno complaints :),0
"Prices to high!! I used to come here all the time, bartender Lisa is great, but the prices are outrageous, fuck the lodge, never coming back",0
This airport is the size of downtown.\nAnd I like the sports bar in Terminal C.\nThat is all.,0
"This is a fun little place. I've been coming in here for about a decade now, lots of fun memories.",0
This store has greatly improved customer service since my last visit. It's more adult now. Good job!,0

"This food was so amazing!!! My family is always having dinner's here. This is one of my all time favorite restaurants. Even when they're busy, they still find time to serve everyone.",0
Belch. Not sure how these places have survived. Save yourself some cash and get Frys deli fried chicken.,0
"I'm a Fan because they fixed my Flat for free, which is standard for Discount Tire. For me FREE is always good.",0
they have the best soup. tge salsa is amazing. toasted and roasted and whatnot. i like the taco and soup combo. he likes the coastal trio. yum!!!,0
Great food prepared to order and generous servings. The burgers are among the best I've ever had. Highly recommended!,0
"Ate here on 7/2712\n\nAlways delicious!  BLT salad with added chicken is so yummy! Great food & service cannot complain. Is pricey so cannot come here often,but wish I could.",0
I've bought several cars here through the years. Both new and used and have had nothing but great experiences. Nice people.,0
HAIR! Found multiple dark hairs in my fries. Thats just nasty. Service sucks. Seems like the kids working here are are more interested in socializing then taking care of customers. I will not be returning.,0
Delivery was 20 minutes sooner than expected. Food was medicore. Nothing to write home about. Better than Big Wa,0
Food is always good never had bad food. Service is good for the most part its very seldom that it is not good. But everyone has a off day. Wish the prices were not so high.,0
ummmm...ummm...There is a Captain Morgan statue in the back. \n\nThat is about all I got! Drinks are overpriced and the door staff is a bit much.,0
Love the Tempe locations vibe.. Good Beer -good food.. We stop by once a month or so for years now.. BIG FAN - you will not go wrong here!!,0
"heard they are having a tenth anniversary? so they've given about 15 haircuts, now?",0
"Awesome meal - flavorful food, large portions, not overly expensive.  The Marscapone dip was outstanding and the bread pudding dessert was one if the best I've had!  Go and enjoy the gluttony!",0
"Always reliable for a great Burger, cold beer and friendly service. Chain food yet worth it. And Mondays kids under 12 (I think) eat free!",0
The people washing and waxing my truck were great.  But the owner and cashiers not so much!,0
Service is decent but the one thing that never fails me is the orange blossom. There is no other hefewiezen that comes close! Hooray for orange blossom beer!,0
"Food is great as always, however the past few times their service has been horrible. We ordered 6 items at once and each dish came out about 15-20 minutes apart. Between the four of us we were starving.",0
Girl at front counter was in a very bad mood didn't even say hi....  dirty and rude.. last time I'm coming here,0
Great soup and Shrimp caprice. The only reason why I go there.,0
"Passing by we stopped in for a quick slice of pie to fortify us for our continuing journey. Not disappointed, the pie was delicious!  some seriously good Jam and a very keen and friendly owner.",0
My boyfriend enjoys brewing his own beer and the guys here are wonderful. They always have the supplies and if they don't they can recommend places to get them! Everyone is always very nice and knowledgeable!,0
"The place is a joke, the food is horrible, the service is just as bad! Save yourself some time and keep driving.",0
"Came here for lunch today, just thought I would share some info. The place was very clean, service was good and all the food seem pretty fresh.",0
The dealers are so knowledgeable and helpful! We always find some great stuff. We just recently purchased vintage blue glass BALL jars from the 1950's for a DIY project.,0
"Poor service, order was wrong ate half meal before found waitress to fix meal! Wasted 35$! Chicken was hard to cut with a knife!",0
Staff are becoming noticeably younger and with that noticeably less helpful. Take the extra five minutes and drive down to the Target on Lake Mead.,0
"Good food, but 14 minutes in drive through at 830 with 4 employees to get a chx sandwich. Will go again though.",0
"I recommend this place for basic facials,  but stay away for nails. It's def worth it to pay the extra money and go to a nail salon.",0
Consistently good Happy Hour. Good burgers and drinks. The downside is how crowded it gets and that the happy hour is only good in the bar. It should be entire restaurant.,0
Every sandwich I've ever had there was delicious. The people are nice and the service is fast.  Cheap too.,0
Pretty good - it's cheap...it's close...and they have some good chinese food for the area. They don't deliver though.,0
"I Love this place they have the best steak spring rolls and hot jasmin tea. Best pho in town not including my girlfriends moms pho!! The service is ok, but the food makes up for any miscommunication.",0
"Indoors the dining area has a chill cave feel, outside has a nice little stream. Local beer on tap, the food has a strong kick so order with caution.",0
Still love their bagels and apparently I am not the only one since they won Phoenix New Times for Best Bagel (2011).,0
"Food is good, service and cleanliness need major improvement. Teen staff mostly ate and was clueless to the customer,\nMoire mature servers, steam clean the place, would be a great experience.",0
"$10 cover, no hats, and they steal your ID.  How is this garbage still in business???",0
Bad service. Really really bad. Food is okay,0
"Combination kabobs are excellent. Wonderful treatment of rice.  Definite value, with a nice atmosphere",0
Third time I've gotten sick after eating here....never again!,0
Manager was rude ruined the entire experience for us. The food was good and the waitress was good. Won't bring my family here until they get new management.,0
"They misdiagnosed our cat as having diabetes. After the cat went into insulin shock they said 'well, sometimes it just goes away.' Seems like they to want to kill animals as expensively as possible.",0
I have eaten here multiple times and my meal has always been fresh and good tasting. The mountain high mud pie is always great if you have the room for it after dinner!,0
Drinks are expensive but free pour!! One drink & your going to feel it lol. Plus the slot pump out coin still pretty cool.,0
Good breakfast spot with friendly service.  Definitely has a diner vibe.,0
"This may be the worst Mexican food I have ever tasted... I was starving and couldn't even finish it.  I got the sampler so I tasted everything, nothing was good:(so sad because they were nice.",0
Excellent lunch place. Reasonable prices and the food was flavorful and delicious. Would definitely go back,0

"I wish more chains had great quality foods and ambience rich environments. I thoroughly enjoyed my roasted turkey, avo blt!",0
To start the Rio Margarita is awesome.\nIm gonna order the pollo ranchero fundido style cause its the bomb! Great food great service all the time!,0
They need more workers poor service had too wait on ordering and then had to wait on food way to long,0
"This location closed mid December 2011.  They have directed members to the LA Fitness at University & Stapley.  LA Fitness purchased a large number of Bally's, and are closing them/consolidating them to LA locations.",0
Excellent food. Great prices. The only place on the west coast with properly prepared bagels. Friendly and polite staff.,0
"Best thai food I've had so far in Las Vegas. Very nice little spot,  clean. Food comes quickly,  very generous serving and always tastes delicious!  I'm currently trying my way through their curry menu - yumm!!!!",0
"A great clinic! I've always had great experiences with the staff here. Friendly, professional and well priced services. Definitely check them out!",0
I love this place.  The staff is amazing and the vibe is cool.  The private tasting area is pretty sweet too.  There are always a lot of great events happening here. I will be back many times!,0
"A shout-out to Proficient Auto Body for the great work yesterday. Had my rear bumper swapped out within a half-day, and terrific staff, to boot.",0
Lovely place to sit and have quiet time. They have a great area for children and helpful staff. They also have a Starbucks with some lunch options. They will serve you on glass plates and warm up your pastries,0
"The food here is amazing, and the service is lightening fast!  The food was out within 10 minutes of us ordering, and it tasted fresh.  The prices are very reasonable, but be sure to bring cash!",0
In impressed! 6/3/14 The staff were less than happy to see me. The sandwich was small and there is too much cinnamon in there sauce. The pulled pork was lacking flavor. Fries were ok.,0
"Sat on patio, tables and chairs way to close. Wait stuff was good but sushi was inconsistent, ie pieces not same size. Rice wasn't wrapped all the way around rolls. Salmon seemed old.",0
"We have been here a few times. Liberty is awesome! They always treat you very kindly and do all they can to help people. I won't go anywhere else. \n\nLiberty, thanks for being there!",0
I like bottom but I like there older menu better. For example I miss the sausage meatloaf vs the new turkey one they replaced it with. Doesn't wow me like the other did. They lose a star with this updated menu.,0
Service is excellent. We are regulars and enjoy the garlic bread and special dishes of the night. The drink selection is fair. It's not a great place to watch sports it's a better place to get to know people and socialize.,0
Good food but the young staff can never get any to go order right. They are too busy talking about their social life,0
I have always enjoyed any location I have eaten at.\nThey offef what other fast food do not offer.,0
I have yet to find a dish I like there. I feel like there are better places for Mexican besides here. Food was mediocre I thought.,0
You guys are awesome! Except for the fact that I wish you opened earlier on weekdays ;) will never go anywhere but DT,0
Had a good little breakfast for under $6.00. Simple decor friendly staff.,0
So tasty...the ranch is yummy! One day I will conquer the pizza challenge!,0
"The food was okay, but with the setting and the hype I'd heard about the place, I expected better. I even had my friends leftovers and his pasta was pretty it was alright, nothing special.",0
Had booked reservation two days pior and Did not accommodate their mishap for not finding us in their reservation because someone didn't write it down and was unwilling to correct it. Made us wait when we had reservation. Manager glenn unwilling to help,0
"Just went back, still in awe of the place.  \n\nWanted to throw my vote behind the smoked gouda spinach dip.  Quite tasty.",0
I took both my doggies here for the first time today and I will never take them anywhere else! Both my dogs have ever had such an adorable haircut. Not only where they affordable but the staff was amazingly skilled and so friendly!,0
"Stick to Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts.  All of the Espresso locations on campus are dirty, usually crowded, and serve consistently burnt tasting drinks.",0
Only 2 stars for location. Rooms are humid and smell like wet dog. Worst hotel I have yet to stay in as a consultant.,0
"Very nice grocery store indeed. Everything is well organized and not messy at all. The fruits were definately of decent quality, well it better for the cost. This is one of my top grocery store for sure.",0
Very tasty food.  Extremely pleasant employees.  Great check-ins through the meal and the drinks didn't go dry.,0
The service at this location is crap. No one speaks English or really cares about customer service,0
"Biscuits and gravy with sausage patty is top notch, and the soda didn't taste funky like in so many places.   It's incredible how lousy the service is every single time.  But I will be back.",0
Poor customer service. Sales person seemed like I was inconveniencing him. Made me just walk out!!,0
"I understand that using office supply stores can be a unique situation; however, I didn't expect the awful arrogance that was flaunted throughout the store.  I will never return to the store, and I will continue to spread my ill feelings.",0
Went in at breakfast time it was semi busy...but not packed. Walked out after 45 mins of waiting for a sandwich. I went to the waffle house instead.,0
"I've never had anything that wasn't absolutly delicious! Great Italian food and if you are in the mood to cook, they have it all for a perfect Italian meal! Try the take out to impress your next dinner party!!",0
"I hate this stores layout...why are the toiletries in between the food isles. Quit trying to cross sell me at the deli counter and no, I don't need any ice or stamps!",0
"It's the best greasy spoon restaurant in the area. I liked it much, much better than Mickie's.\n\nBe sure to get some cash before you go here.",0
oh my gosh these pizza's are huge! i love a good pie with everything on it (minus anchovies) and these are as good as it gets.,0
Great for take out only. There place is too small for a sour down restaurant.  Their spicy tuna sucked.,0
"I used to go here and get a monthly massage with Dan. I like deep tissue and he does a fenominal job. I just couldn't afford the monthly membership anymore, as it gets pricy and forget about regular prices.",0
"umm..yea, all I will say is not-so-great.  For what it is, its expensive and the owner is a jerk.",0
Some of the best views from a golf course in the valley!!!  I will be playing this a few times a year and I only play about 8-10 times each year.,0
After sitting there and being ignored for 25 minutes we just left!,0
As authentic as Chinese food gets here. Fairly clean for an Asian restaurant with clashing decorations galore. We had a fairly large party and ordered around 7 dishes. Food is good!,0
"Average quality, barely, and lacking in taste and originality. The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily. \n\nThere were a lot of families here... they must have cheap kids menu or something.",0
Amazing pizza and calzones.  the crust is so crispy and the sauce is great.  I'm from the east coast and this really feels like I'm back there,0
"really good neighborhood place. The lunch buffet is great, especially if you are unsure what to order. You can try a few different things. The tandoori chicken and tiki Marsala are incredible!",0
Tonight my bf and I was here the service was alright the buggers was good the fries was a bit over cooked,0
"....my hair looks fine, but I swear to God the young lady cutting it was intentionally jabbing me with the sheers.",0
Big banner on the outside prints Best Pho in Las Vegas?  But taste all the same to me.,0
"Marginal dancers, poor choreography, many out of shape dancers with to many stretch marks.  Blonde bartender cutest of bunch to bad she didn't dance.",0
Great little diner. I got the Hiboy Burger with sweet potato fries and it was amazing. They use a good quality beef that doesn't shrink down a lot after they cook it. Sweet potato fries were nice and crispy.,0
"Been a couple of times now. Staff always attentive. Food fresh and lots of choice. \nWould go again and recommend. Free wifi a bonus. Oh, also Wednesday is free slice of pie day when you order a meal!",0
Nothing about the Italian sandwich is Italian. It was gross. I've never not finished an Italian sandwich until today. The Wisconsin Cheese soup tastes like Velveeta. My water was my favorite part of the meal.,0
First visit I saw the Doctor in 30 minutes.  The second visit was about an hour.  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  All questions I had were answered.,0
The people here are very nice and friendly. After I paid I felt as if they were trying to rush me out the door.,0
Sorry to break to you but  it seems another Village  inn has bitten the dust...,0
Nine am on a thursday morning and not one piece of toilet paper in the restroom.  Really??? Um yeah I just drank coffee.,0
"Delightful, we were there for Sunday brunch. Great food, pleasant conversation and very reasonable.  Making a point to return for dinner.",0
"How in heaven's name anyone could rate this restaurant above a 1 is beyond me.  Meat quality is definitely low grade.  Avoid at all costs, even though they appear to be low.",0
Best pozole in town! I go every chance I get. Everyone is extremely hospitable and The chips and salsa are great.,0
Great subs and great deals at this location. Perfect for student. 15 inches for under $6 and much better than subway.,0
"We buy most of our groceries here. They have fresh produce, awesome bulk foods, good meat choices, and a nice beer selection. Above all, they have great prices and awesome sales! Our 20 month old son loves going here too.",0
Fantastic happy hour! Cheap beers and appz.. can't go wrong with a tall stella and some boneless honey bbq wings!,0
"Unprofessional staff, streaked windows and mirrors. I was very disappointed with the outcome of my car wash. The interior of my car was not completely cleaned either.\nI will never go back!",0
"Everything is great except for the fried wings. The wings are very bland and have no flavor. The BBQ WAS Incredible, the beans, mashed potatoes, gravy, and oh the onion strings are incredible.",0
"Had bbq pork sandwich.  It was good, but over priced. No lids for your soda? Wth? Wish they served fries instead of potato chips.",0
Smoked beef is the best. My favorite Mexican restaurant.,0
The service is horrendous. Went there numerous times and my orders have been messed up.,0
Great happy hour specials. Lots of food selections and drinks. A good mix of food as well,0
If you're around stop by and have the wood fired pizza! I promise its the best pizza you will ever eat. And not to mention the fantastic atmosphere! It is such a beautiful building with original architecture still in place. Amazing!,0
I only ever do Tepanyaki seating here but it never disappoints!,0
A fake plant in the corner was so thick with dust it made me question the cleanliness of the kitchen. Every door was dirty even the entrance doors which were glass and easy to clean. Food was not awesome.,0
Awesome Doctor and staff! They take good care of my husband and seem to really care about the patients!  Best skin care specialist on Az!,0
"Ribs were good, but sauce was a little too sweet.  Review was so close to 4 stars but the corn was cooked in margarine. Really?  Margarine?  C'mon you're in Wisconsin.",0
"You get what you pay for.  It's cheap, yet very subpar compared to pizza joints in California.  No selection of condiments...no mercy.  The White Pizza is pretty good though.",0
The food is okay. The creamed corn and banana pudding are my fav. Drive through is convenient!,0
Beware gift cards expire. Who does that anymore?  If I pay you $100. Why should it expire?  Stupid!,0
Food and service were mediocre at best. Cost was about the same as anywhere else. Would rather go to Breakfast Club.,0
My husband and I love Del Taco. The burritos and grilled chicken tacos are good. The ingredients are fresh (for a fast food spot) and it isn't expensive. Not too mention they're open 24 hours!,0
I've said on more than a few occasions that my meal of choice was the best tasting italian item Id ever tasted. I love the Alfredo dishes.... \nAnd excellent chicken Marsala!,0
10 TIMES better than the Phx Zoo.....,0
The food wasn't that great- so I'm not a fan - the salad was the only thing worth eating,0
Service is shaky but the food is always great! It's hard to find a restaraunt that takes nutrition into consideration when creating a menu and Pita Jungle does just that.,0
A great family business. They are a pleasure to work with and very good at problem solving.,0
The service here is really good! The food here is also very good! Of all the other good eggs this one is the place to come too! They have so any different options to choose from..,0
I love this place! That's all!\n\nThank you for making no rice sushi rolls for me while I was on my diet!,0
The dining area is really small!  I still put this McD's better than the one in Buckeye.  We actually had a pretty nice experience dining in.  The cashier was really nice.,0
Stopped here to buy some flowers and garden supplies. Prices were good. Aisles clean. Asked by several different workers if we needed help finding anything. Checking out was quick.,0
Great service great price!!! They'll take any competitors coupon even if the deal is an amazing deal. I paid way less than I expected for my very worn out breaks.,0
"The food was delicious, but the service was not that great. No one checked on us once between the time we received our food to the time we were ready for the check.",0
"Crowded on a Saturday. No parking, a little dirty. NOT GOING BACK",0
Food was ok but generic. The caprese had refrigerated tomatos.  The beet salad was good.  The risotto with the short ribs was terrible. It's a chain. What do you expect.,0
Great food. Restaurant is undergoing renovation - but don't let that stop you from going there.,0
"FOOD OK, clean? NOT! the floor and restrooms needed alot of help. Dont care to ever go back, but the kids like it.",0
"This place does decent Thai food, but is nothing special. There was nothing memorable or notable about my meal. The service was decent. This is one of few places in downtown Pittsburgh where a vegan can go and be reasonably accommodated.",0
Great happy hour specials.  Great food and yummmmy food. Wednesday has family night specials.,0
Place is abandoned and locked down. Phone is out of service.  Still merchants inside just no one to sell it.,0
One of my favorite places off strip. Good pizza and Mediterranean options. I love their lobster bisque and their hummus with garlic pita bread. Good selection of beers too.,0
"Stay at the hyatt for a much better hotel, breakfast included there and it's AMAZING. Stay here cause it's on mill ave. not that nice, room is smaller than what you can get at the hyatt.",0
I used to go there was good food and the price was reasonable but now the food is sort of fairy and the price is skyrocket. Not worth going there.,0
"Average for me, NJ pizza rules, this place was ok, no complaints.",0
Fehgedaboudit.  Ordered large shrimp and they served me what looked & tasted like bread or batter in the shape of large shrimp.,0
What a bunch of professional and happy people. Very attentive and helpful crew. Very pleased with this office,0
Everything seems great except you have to pay for internet which I think is really stupid. I would rather stay at a hotel without a casino than stay here.,0
Love this place!  The staff is always nice and helpful. They have great products and they are knowledgeable about the ingredients in their products.\nWe definitely like to support small businesses that care about customer service.,0
Meh. I've experienced better. The food is mediocre and the service is slow. For better pad thai try Spice Island Tea House.,0
it was a dump. There was no one around to help. and half the machines were down.,0
"Exquisite. Beautiful interior, excellent food, and friendly service. Coconut curry shrimp was outstanding. Go. Go now.",0
"This is a great location, especially when the weather is nice and you can sit outside.  Their food is flavorful, fresh and unique.  Great wine list and a fun ambiance.",0
I had a vegetarian sandwich with fresh avocado. And a decent amount!   Loved the bread. Definitely home made. Had a side salad that was substantial. Wait staff friendly. I will Return!,0
"Watch out for the crack windshield guys, after you make a claim to your insurance your rates will go up for filing a claim.",0
Prices have gone up at way to much for the food and the service is not always good. I had to keep asking for drink refills and chips,0
"My first time eating here... Oh my goodness... why would anyone eat here food is gross.  worst chicken  ever, it was like rubber.",0
Went on their website and requested a callback 3 days ago. Still waiting for them to call.,0
"I've been here so many times with groups, and each time the food is at best mediocre. You know it's a bad sign when an Asian restaurant never has any Asian customers.",0
Great affordable service. I overheard JJ say that his shop has been open for 16 years and it shows. Awesome unique old time barber shop decor. Cash only.,0
"Walked over before a dbacks game. Loved the beer garden, nice draft selection and good tunes. It will likely become tradition before future games.",0
Average bar with a nice outdoor area. You can go cornholing there which is fun.\n\nWish the beer selection was better.,0
"They don't really have a great selection. I'm not even sure they had any new releases. The majority of it is 70's & 80's rock. They do have really good prices if that is your musical genre preference, though.",0
Excellent place to unwind in hectic downtown!,0
Best best Thai I've found in charlotte. The atmosphere is welcoming and friendly. And the food very flavor filled. Order #32 with a fried egg added and you cannot go wrong.,0
Offers the same great items the one on South Blvd does the only downside to this location is the lack of deli and smoothie/juice stand.,0
Good bar food. Cash only. Seat yourself first come first sere. The walnut burger was decent and had the warm chips and blue cheese dips was not bad. Very cozy place with banquet style seating.,0
I live in Colorado and was returning home to Wisconsin for a wedding. So happy to find this amazing little diner off of Highway 151. A hardy old-fashioned breakfast with real food and friendly service,0
Good company. I had them put sun screens on 2 houses. I immediately noticed a temperature difference. They provide good customer service. Del even fixed an internal screen that was damaged free of charge.,0
"Great food, great prices. It's really fast and you don't even need to call your order in.",0
"Had the Walu (Hawaiian butterfish), and was excellent.  Sushi was good, my friends said best ever, I thought more average.  Rock shrimp appetizer also average.  Wait staff was excellent.",0
"Kitchen was very slow, all food did not come at same time 15 minutes from the first delivery of food until the last person got there. The food was extremely over cooked and cold \n\nWould never come back",0
"The Chip is my favorite place to be on a Friday night. \nBe prepared for an old style country bar! Dancing, bull riding, fire pits and BBQ!",0
"The food was amazing! The chicken is amazing, the warm maple syrup and the various southern side dishes are all wonderful. Jake an was our server and he was incredibly attentive, personable and knowledgable. Definitely will be back soon!!",0
Believe the DDD hype. The calzone was perfect. Pizza was great. Service was some of the best and friendliest ever. They do not rest on their laurels. A must try.,0
I ate it and I didn't die. I'm so happy to say these words. What more can you say about greasy rice and cogulated 'brown' sauce?,0
poor service took them 3 weeks to fix one darn bumper. NEVER do business with them EVER again.,0
The people here are extremely friendly and the food is so damn good. My favorite dish is the beef and broccoli,0
"I agree with most other reviewers... They are pretty darn fast for lunch rush in drive thru, never had a mistake on my order and the people are nice in drive thru. Good for them at serving people the right way.",0
We went and the service was slow and our food was wrong.  I won't go back.,0
Breakfast was great! Some of the best chorizo con huevo I've had in the valley. \n\nSalsa was good and spicy!,0
Always great service. Food very good. European portions. Pricey bit well worth it.,0
The rice was hard and the beans were cold. That was a terrible example for mexican food tonight. (12/26/2011),0
Great service. Great people. What else can you ask for?! I recommend this cleaners to everybody!,0
"Good barbeque, even better banana pudding. Customer service is the best you'll find. Definitely why they have been in business so long.",0
"Best place to go for your happy hour drinks! Nerds Slushes are awesome, Employees are always have great attitudes, makes me want to always go back.",0
It's old.  It's small.  The staff was attentive.  Food showed up quick and tasted like IHOP food.,0
"This Dennys has great service, its open late, its clean and hardly crowded.",0
"Chicken sandwich was like a piece of leather.    Go figure that one.    Got a boiled dinner.    Not much to full one up!    Sorry Charlie, this fish is not going back",0
I got the wings. Great Sauce. Crispy Wings. The only let down was the price. $14 for a dozen wings seems a little steep. Thats like Room Service Prices.,0
When I'm in town for something special I go to Monti' s. Never disappointed in the food or the service. Made a reservation on my way into town on a busy night and got to walk right in to my waiting table.,0
This is my favorite place in town.  The sandwiches are the best I have ever had and i am never disappointed by how fresh all the ingredients are.,0
Fast service there today. I was in and out in no time through their drive up. Food was fresh and hot and very good.,0
"Interior design is nice. Had the pho and so far this is the best place for pho, except for at home.",0
"Went for Restaurant Week with a friend. Adorable little place, wonderful atmosphere. The squid was just slightly overcooked but everything else was perfect. Service was great. Bring your own wine.",0
"Food is sub-par/prices average. But hey, I'm from Ca.",0
Lame. Don't believe the fat old bald guy out front that says it's illegal to use anything but their drivers. He's a liar. Use uber. It's cheaper.,0
Best queso fondito with chorizo i have had in Las Vegas. Good mojito's and margaritas. Friendly staff. Good atmosphere. Pretty good al pastor but not the best. Would come to this restaurant again.,0
"Giants need a new spring training park. It's cool and all, but nothing compared to the new cactus league yards. \n\nYo Yo",0
Favorite salad bar in the universe. Date night with the biological leaves me feeling satisfied every time,0
"it was ok, no music or anything fun going on. He re polished my toes which lasted a long time. :-). Manicured my nails ok",0
EXCELLENT weekend buffet-- best assortment of high quality food I have seen in an Indian buffet and very reasonable price. I highly recommend this to everyone!,0
From living in NYC for 27 years I tried this place and I took one bite and threw it all away. And very expensive,0
Worst service ever! Didn't have many domestic beers an the they where not draft. We had to ask our waiter for everything.,0
Guacamole needs help! Fish tacos were good. Taco salad was good too. They need to keep doors closed to keep flies out!!!,0
Awesome place our kickball team goes here almost every Monday.. The staff is always nice and friendly and food and drinks are fast.. There prices are great. Love this place cant wait till next week for more...:),0
"This place blows.  Staff seems bored and depressed, not to mention rude.  Plus there was a 20 minute wait for an empty bar/restaurant.  Lame.",0
"Do not eat here.  It is awful!  The food tastes old, re-heated.  Really bad.  You couldn't pay me to eat here again.",0
"Again, out of creamer for the coffee.",0
Good ice cream but great environment!  Very cute.,0
Me and one of my besties had such a relaxing day here. Such a cute place and the pool is a nice touch!!,0
The airport was easy to navigate and I got my luggage quickly. I wasn't crazy about walking in the heat to the bus to the rental car area.,0
This place is CLOSED  on Sunday October 20. The phone number (both on Yelp and in the door) isn't working and the inside looks empty.,0
Restaurant looks dull and old. Food tasted worse than expected and some dishes were not fresh. Service was ok. I do not recommend trying the dimsum menu,0
"Best burger anywhere.  A Pittsburgh landmark.  The best hostess -- charming, firendly, makes everyone feel at home and as if you are her only concern.  The burgers are the highest quality meat, cooked to perfection.",0
Wanted to ghost hunt but was too drunk and had a blast with naked chicks in the pool. Walls are paper thin...,0
They have boba milk teas here in North Las vegas. \n\nEddie was excellent cashier. Bogo on milk teas and smoothies (:,0
Great value sub sandwiches!! Love going here with a sweet location.,0
"Ran in for a quick lunch, had the cheese burger special.  Good food at a fair price, bartender (Stephanie) is a great gal.  I've always had a good time!",0
"Over hyped, food doesn't have that much taste, but it is a long wait!",0
"Green burrito enchilada style   yum, intriguing flaver but delicious,will be returning in spite of tacky plastic plates and  bland chips.",0
Waited 30 minutes for my French dip to arrive before walking out.  The dirty glasses and silverware did not help either.,0
OMG the best sushi and sashimi I've ever had in my life. The staff is very friendly and made some great recommendations. The screaming orgasizm was awesome. A must try,0
"When I am having a sugar craving after busting out a gargantuan trail run, I hit this place up. Muffins, cupcakes, all sorts of gluttony inducing items.",0
We have been taking our daughters here for over 10 years and they are one of the best if not the best in the Valley.  Very knowledgeable and helpful.  You can't go wrong here.,0
Seems weird to order wings at an italian joint but they're amazing!!! Have never had a bad meal at Oreganos!,0
"I like to layout but its always crowded and hard to find a table.  Also, the music is too loud and distracting, an okay place to go chill maybe but not if you need to study or get work done.",0
"I have used Sergio's for years and have nothing but good to say. The price is fair you know what you are going to pay and they do a great job cleaning up the yard when they are done, including the weeds.",0
"Carefree Resort...not my choice.  I can \""care less\"" about this place.  Rooms smell like a sewer and the employees are not friendly.  I hope I won't be returning!",0
Kohl's is a great store when it comes to value. The store on Valley Verde is enormous and right off the 215 East. \n\nNice staff \nGreat Value\nName Brands,0
"This was not the same place I remembered as a teen in California. Menu was completely different and has a bad attempt of being like a subway. On a good note the bread was fresh, but sadly I won't hit it up again.",0
"Great food and fabulous service. Sad to leave food on the plate, bit the portions are huge.",0
Great little hole in the wall bar.  They have Karaoke which was a lot of fun.. Stiff drinks and the most interesting and diverse crowd I have ever seen in Madison.,0
"Grotesque food, vulgar staff, blech.",0
"Cool place, but do NOT get the chicken. Mine was like rubber, I had to send it back and just didn't eat. So gross. Dirty place. But seems fun if you get drunk",0
They are the best cleaners I have had in the valley.,0
Went there with some friends who had the hibachi which looked okay. I just had sashimi which was very underwhelming. Have had much better elsewhere.,0
Really awesome mexican food! I got the super burrito for my first time here and it was excellent! I will return! :D,0
It's nice to find a healthier buffet option. They have plenty of vegetables and other salad toppings to choose from.,0
Great location but the food is mediocre. Really nothing special.  Ever since they renovated it (which is a lot larger) the quality of the food has decreased.,0
The Food at Mama Ricotta's is very good!  The Pasta Entrees  are fresh and they have a wide variety of Dishes!!!!!!,0
totally lame music videos at deafening volume and waited 8 minutes and still no waitress service oh and there was only 7 other people in the place no thanks!,0
"Great asian food, excellent service and close to uptown businesses.  The only downside is that during lunch it can be difficult to get a table with the lunch rush.  Arrive early or late in order to get in.",0
Their food was super delish. Their portions were huge so next time I prob would have split the plate. Def would go again,0
the place where all you gotta have is a record to work there!!!sweet!!!,0
"Mosquitoes, like out of a science fiction novel. Nice course, nice clubhouse, but again the bugs were absolutely intense. Don't know if that's true year round.",0
"Great food at reasonable prices, if you like PF Changes you'll love Pei Wei. Same company and very similar food.",0
"Mediocre at best for concerts. Long, rectangular space that is absolutely flat. If you are not fairly close to the stage you can't see the stage. Weird layout...",0
Stopped in here for a quick hand wash.  I had them wash my black car on the side rather than running it through the tunnel.  For $25 not a bad job.  A few swirl marks but overall pretty good.,0
"Nice atmosphere, great staff only place I can find Top Gear magazine!! \nI think this is what Borders is known for, having a broader selection. This magazine is published in Britain and it's hard to find in the states.",0
"Great food. Nice environment. The service is too slow, so try here when you have plenty of time.",0
Their smoked salmon commuter sandwich is simply mouth watering. Highly recommended!,0
It seems management has told the sushi chefs to exercise portion control. We were served a roll that had so little of the spicy tuna that the end pieces were all rice. Fry's fresh sushi counter serves better rolls! And it's less expensive!!,0
"Great diner with tons of vegetarian and vegan options.   They even have the Trempeleau walnut burger!! My husband got the Elvis shake, which was beautiful and he must have liked because he gobbled it up.",0
California has much better vermicelli. The fish oil had no flavor. The grilled pork wasn't seasoned like it should and the vermicelli not good.,0
I've been going here for quite some time. I love their lunch buffet.  They make the best saag in town. I'll go just for the saag and a piece of naan. Its like butter.,0
Pizza is good and you can't beat the beer selection.   Theirs wings have a good sauce also.,0
Food was good but soup wasn't hot.  Service was incredibly slow even though no one was in the restaurant but a couple other two tops.  I'd come back but try a different server next time.,0
"A Mecca for the morbidly obese!  Whatever it is they are putting out on those warming tables, I'm not sure that you should call it pizza!",0
Great service from Ahmod at the counter it's really nice to find great customer service this day and age. Nice job cobblestone team! Especially Ahmod!,0
Great wedding. Brittany and Brian were so cool. I loved the laughter and the spirituality. I thought Shenendoah did a good job with food and the setting was nice.,0
"Negative, droning on and on about negative things....yes, Arizona is full of negative news - but it serves no purpose to report it.  I have never heard such negative news reporting in my life.  Yuck.",0
"This location sucks... They cant get simple orders correct. I only get coffee or ice cream from mcdonalds,  I don't like the food at all.",0
I got house chips with my sandwich. I thought house chips are cooked in restaurant. I received store bought ruffle chips in a plastic sandwich bag. Lol,0
"I highly recommend trying the pizza muffins (both the original and the pepperoni). Unfortunately, our experience was overshadowed by EXTREMELY poor service. And on the night we had out of town guests? We won't be back...",0
I ordered my meal very clearly to the cashier but they got it wrong. I didn't like the food it was dry. I won't be eating there again. The floors were dirty too.,0
it's just fun hanging out at Starbucks with great coffee in hand.,0
"If you are looking for a dive bar, here you go. Nothing fancy, just good drinks, better prices and a fun atmosphere tucked away. Iguana balls are tasty as well.",0
"Over priced food, poor customer service.\nOwner is VERY rude & inconsiderate!!",0
"Typical Target.  Limited food selection, decent electronics and clothing selection.  Staff isn't super friendly but not what I'd call rude either.  I could take it or leave it.",0
"Excellent. Ordered the Korean spicy beef dish. It was great. Worth the drive. I will definitely go there again, for sure.",0
I had lunch here today with two very nice ladies and a beautiful baby. The atmosphere was good and accommodations for the baby was good too. They frequently checked on us and brought fresh warm chocolate cookies to our table. I will go back again.,0
The service was great but the food was all right.  I've been to several Qdoba's and this one was just not up to par.,0
Very relaxing facial and massage. Affable staff. Reasonable pricing compared to other spas in the area.,0
"Food was very good.\n\nCustomer service was TERRIBLE!! \nNo one person even said HELLO, or made us feel welcomed with ever a smile.",0
Really yummy! Hit the spot when I was craving some tacos and jaritos!,0
"This is not going to blow your sox off... but they food is consistent, good variety, and decent quality.\n\nI like their green chili best. Pretty much all I get there now when I go.",0
Took longer to rent my car than fly here.  Absolutely ridiculous.  I was told it would be a 30 min wait and it's been three times that- still waiting... All the chairs in their lobby are full of angry customers.,0
"Food average at best,but salad bar was good.Breading on broasted chicken way \""too heavy\""..Service OK.No happy hour in bar.On \""plus side\"" I felt like the youngest person there.",0
"Surprisingly bland and tasteless, but must be popular, as it was very crowded on a Saturday lunch.  Beans are delish, tho.",0
"Recently rented a car from Enterprise and had great service.  The car was ready, clean and the staff was great!",0
"Just did carry out. Panda Express is WAY better. Actually, Taco Bell is better.",0
Good food and great service. Can get busy with a long wait at lunch. I like the burritos. The blackened Mahi is great.,0
"Orderd pizza on line got a 16\"" sausage and extra cheese pizza, came nice and hot, got it in 38 min. Perfect. Loved it!!!",0
Chips were good but crushed to little bits. Shrimp cocktail was terrible. Cilantro rice pretty good.,0
Everything was great.  The Tomato soup was blissful.  Beautiful venue and exception service.  Luv it.,0
Did camp zoo at phx zoo and the kids had a marvelous time. They got to meet the animals in their habitats and learn about the various animals in the park. One of the better camps in Phoenix.,0
"Today I tried someone new, and she did a great job.  She even bumped up my micro peel to a better one! I have been going to voci for 16 years!",0
"While the food was ok, our rating is driven by the wonderful service provided by Margaret.",0
Food was good and full of exciting flavors. Would put 3 $$$ for price.,0
I was served dirty plates and the most awkward cup of green tea ever (a plastic cup full of large leaves with a bit of hot water)...when I complained..of course no one spoke english. This place sucks..,0
"Love the wings and fries! Sometimes it can get loud in there with all the drunks, but the service is always good!",0
"Well, the customer service is great and the work is spectacular, but their pricing is insane!!! They wanted DOUBLE what most of the other shops wanted for a fairly simple repair.",0
This place totally surprised me. The staff was warm and friendly and the food was both unique and very fresh. The  gnocchi was excellent. They even had a kids menu although they seem to cater more toward adults.,0
"Love it, almost every time to Vegas got to have dim sum at Cathay House. Everything is good! don't miss it.",0
not the best in the valley but it is good. nice cheap lunch! i been there 3-4 times and would go back.,0
"Great food, great beer, great televisions and great service.  \n\nThat about covers it.\n\nOh and they have Golden Tee.  Get the appetizer sampler.",0
"Forget that it's located in Walmart, just ask for Corena.  She is amazing, listened to everything I needed and gave me a great haircut.",0
"FYI... Although Yelp says its good for kids, it is not. There is a sign on the door at the hostess stand that says no children under the age of 6 are allowed.",0
"Decent. Service is a little better than most dim sum places, but that's not saying much. The food is just okay. The fried rice is probably the best compared to other local dim sum places.",0
"We met with Angel, one of the specialist here at Sprint. We were impressed with the customer service rendered to us by him. He was professional, polite, patient and answered our questions with ease. Thanks Angel. Keep up the great work.",0
"Its alright, I think they are better then Sweet Tomatoes. They offer more variety then Sweet tomatoes and they are cheaper. You get a coupon for Souper salad, then i would go here.",0
Had a catered lunch here. It was ok. View was great. I'd go back for the free food but not if I had to pay for it.,0
Great little Mexican place. The interior is very nice and updated. They have the best tortillas around and the prices are very good. If you haven't been here you should definitely check it out.,0
"We ordered the lobster, a seafood soup, Chinese vegetables and a fried fish with tofu. All was great. Portions are generous. The service was prompt and nice most of the servers speak little English but not a biggie.",0
"Don't let the outside scare you, Woodlands is really a great restaurant. Clean and has very tasty authentic food at reasonable prices. Their dosas are amazing! They usually have a $9 buffet on the weekends as well.",0
"First time here... Food was really good.. Daughter had a noodle bowl. I had a wrap, we split the wings. We will be coming back.. The only bad thing,no salt in the place.. It could use a little",0
If you want to experience old vegas this would be a good starter. 2 out of 5 stars.,0
"The food was overpriced, the service was disappointing, and the portions were small. I feel like that summarizes this restaurant adequately. Better places out there. ESPECIALLY for mexican food.",0
Very helpful. Knew exactly what I needed (a grappling hook) and pointed me in the right direction. I will use them again. Very nice.,0
"Great beer, amazing food. Parking is the only drawback. It's like being in a real city.",0
Richard had great customer service and accommodated our needs.,0
"Like many others I assume, I'm just trying the new \""add a review\"" feature from the app. That being said, it's Starbucks. Always consistent and at a premium price.",0
I love Volcano Tea. There is a place I think is better but volcano has the variety and right price. All of their drinks are good. They use some fresh ingredients and their boba is good. They take cards now.,0
Located in the backyard of a residential neighborhood. Wait gets long - get there early or try another day. Not mind blowing barbecue just nice family style place.,0
"One of my favorite places to go for a great meal.    Chopped Salad, Filet, Baked Potato, Dessert! Awesome meal!!!",0
"This is definitely a top of the line restaurant, and the prices reflect that. I've eaten there a few times the last time I had salmon it was really good.",0
"Final warning! you will be disappointed no matter what price you pay.\nPlayed Dove Valley last year, beautiful, not now.",0
The delivery is insanely fast!  And the food is delicious!  My daughter loves the chicken lo mein and I really like the General Tso's chicken and the crab puffs.,0
Love this place. Awesome eats. Kick ass staff. Late night hours. Fabulous Tuesday night.,0
"Service at bakery checkout is terrible,  very rude and slow service.",0
It was good as always. I'm in a hurry to get to a show but I really wanted to post this picture of Jen. Lol,0
Went to BWW this weekend since we had a gift card. While the service was great the food was not. Flatbread was awful and the wings were just ok.,0
"The food is okay but the selection of food has dwindled.  However, the location is perfect and when you want to stuff your face this is the place for a great price.",0
Horseshoes too! Every Monday night at 7pm for action in the pits.,0
"Pretty Ok food. I ordered Kung Pao chicken, it really didnt have that much chicken but it had a great flavor. Also order Egg fried rice and that was good too.",0
Good consistent steak house.  Great decor and friendly staff.  Good wine list and scotch list.  Need more fish and steak specials....,0
This was some of the best pizza I've had. The crust was perfect. We will be ordering takeout again from here. Delicious pizza and calzone.,0
Great Sunday breakfast after church.  The staff is friendly and was great with my daughter.  Croissants are yummy and my daughter loved the cookies after the meal.,0
First time calling this company for garage door repair.  Impressed!  They responded within two hours.  Took the time to do the job right.  I highly recommend this company for your garage door issues.,0
My breakfast was disgusting last time. Waits have been so long! Waiter was dull. My eggs were half cooked. Way over priced.,0
"Very boring pizza, if you don't like garlic, oregano, any spices, and think ketchup is pretty good then this is the spot for you.",0
This place has a fun dance atmosphere. It's actually geared for the Gay community but on Thursdays a lot of striaght people go as well which is fun.,0
"I used to love this place, but something is obviously different now. Frozen seafood, small portions, so-so service and staff not knowing the menu. In a town starving for a good Italian restaurant, this one is just not worth it.",0
"grungy, gross, depressing atmosphere at this office.  dr licata was very short, impersonal, and unnecessarily rude during the entire consult.  i will never ever consider a return visit to this office.",0
Dive right in! It's my favorite dive in Urbana but since Gremer is gone it's not quite the same. Had to move westward to the other side of the tracks to see my favorite bartender.,0
Worst quesodilla i have ever had.  It was more lettuce and beans than actual cheese which I'm pretty sure is not how a quesodilla is normally made.,0
Above average for airport food.   The service was friendly and the food was fresh.   The eating area needed a good cleaning.    A free to cookie to finish off the meal......better then expected.,0
Solid deals on some great Veggies and Fruit. Get there early for prime selection. This place can get busy..79 cents for Kale???!? Crazy prices like that. 8 Bell Peppers for $1,0
"This was probably one of the worst places I've eaten at in a while. I'm not sure what was worse food or service. Never again, the coupon we bought and weren't allowed to use left on the table",0
the guy has issues.\n\nI think unless your're a good looking girl won't even help you. \n\nDon't waste your time,0
Good service and the manager Mr Todd took time to help me with my final reading for my TB test. Thank you,0
"Signed up on the internet yesterday. Today, eating a full free breakfast and its good. Smartphone coupons,google it.",0
One star for the massive headache I got after I ate the food... MSG?  Not sure.,0
Owners are very rude people. Course never in good condition. Not worth money or hassle of bad costumer service,0
First time here. Well organized and clean. Very friendly staff. Reasonable prices and large space. Down side... In rough neighborhood. Wouldn't come alone at night and definitely locked my car. Will come again.,0
"These guys always do a thorough job. My rig looks good every time. Really great value in a car wash.  Been there with my old VW van, and with my late model Touraeg and they give equal attention to both.",0
"Awesome.  Just awesome.  The gyro meat is made the way it should be and shaved off when you order.  Its a messy, greasy bundle of deliciousness.  And the fries are good too.",0
Great outdoor seating and bingo.\n\nGood beer selection.,0
This restaurant was spectacular! They serve heaping proportions and the customer service is second to none.   We ordered the chili verde and lobster omelet. The warm banana nut bread mets in your mouth. Highly recommended eatery.,0
"My go-to place when I want bad food, amateur drinkers and bartenders who try to overcharge or under-change.",0
"The family meals here are a good deal.  They provide a lot of food for a reasonable price.  Quality is decent.  Usually the meals will include soup, a veggie dish, some meat dishes, and a dessert.",0
Luke going to Harkins Theatre to watch movies. I gave it 4 stars not because they serve that nasty coke products,0
"Awesome as usual.  Delivery was right on time, both the order taker were pleasent and professional, and the pizza has always and seams to continue to rock.",0
Store is always fully stocked and clean.\n\nThey finally got the mini Starbucks area finish and open!!,0
This is my favorite QT.\nKnow why?\nI'll tell you why.\nProximity.\nThat's it.\nBAM,0
"As always this place rocks, the new Thai beef salad is so good and spicy but the big huge surprise was the big island meatloaf.  If you like pig and beef mixed together with a crispy crust then get this piece of heaven.",0
Food was good.  Portions were small.  Not the cleanest retaurant I've ever been in.,0
I went there last night for dinner and they closed the place down!!!  I am devastated!  I loved Furr's...,0
"I really like this place. The food is consistent and high quality, and the prices and service are excellent. They are often busy and the actual restaurant decor, etc. is nothing special, but you are there for the food, right?",0
Service is bad and also the food here are awful. Prob is one of the worst Chinese food. Not gonna come back here again.,0
Wish I still lived in Vegas just so I could eat here. BEST Mexican food I've ever had.,0
The food was AMAZING...\nThe service was mediocre.\nThe hostess ruined our entire experience.,0
Very interesting airport. The minute I stepped into the airport from my plane I saw a bunch of slot machines. HAHA! Otherwise everything is okay. It took us a while to find buses to commute.,0
Great for Happy Hour! Must try the calamari and Saki Bombs.,0
"Pretty good place to grab a few drink. Extremely expensive for the area however. I also don't understand their happy hour,.50 cents off drafts? That's pretty lame if you ask me considering their happy hour is always dead.",0
I love my daughter's coaches. Especially when they let me know she isn't doing what she's suppose to do.  My daughter has been doing gymnastics since 2 and this is my favorite spot so far.,0
"Not sure what happened here @ Casey's, the Guinness is not being poured correctly, is it too busy, understaffed, untrained bar keep?\nI'll go to Rula or Fibbers next time.",0
My Second Cheba Hut visit....hit the other one in SD.\n\nWOW...another 5 star place.,0
"Great food, great service, great atmosphere. I had their buffalo shrimp and it was amazing. They claim to have the meatiest wings, I will be checking that out next time.Love this place,I will be going back soon.",0
"Wow, awesome and old school! Nicest car wash I've ever been to and for $9.48 and getting the interior all done its a sweet deal!",0
Favorite sushi spot in chandler! Could use some better lunch specials tho!! Maybe a Poke salad like RA... Just sayin,0
LOVE the pig wings! i could drink the sauce that comes with them!,0
"Oh, baked almond torte, how I love you. Why, though, must you be so caloric!?!  It distresses me that I must save you for special occasions.",0
i have to change my review after talking to bobby the general manager he turned me over to Vince who went out of his way to make us happy. Very pleased,0
Grandson arriving at Term.2. Yea!  Ages since I've been to term 2 but it's easier to get in and out of than term 4,0
They have a decent menu and really good prices.  You do get a decent amount of food for the price that you pay.  The Fried Ice Cream is the best that I have had in my opinion!,0
"Hired them as a present, they did an ok job. But I highly recommend getting a cleaning company for someone when they have no time and you can't be there,",0
"Great falafel! Hummus was absolutely delicious, service was great very clean place. We will be back to try more.",0
"My hubby and I loved this place! We went for the first time yesterday, and we had a very pleasant experience. The food was plentiful and unique, and the service was awesome. We will definitely go again!",0
Good bk food. Slow service. Drive through is a 10 min stop even if your the only one in line. Always feels like i am bugging the person at the window.,0
I was at this part of town and stopped at this IHop for lunch. It was such a pleasant experience with a really great waitress. She had only been working there fo about 8 months. What great service. Thank you so much!,0
"I stopped in here for lunch on the way to a Dbacks day game.  As mentioned by others, the tomato, mozz and basil sandwich is awesome.  I sat outside at one of the picnic tables and enjoyed every bite.",0
"My absolutely favorite dish is the potato gnocchi. Just amazing! Service is fantastic, nice decor. I wish they wouldn't use such huge paper towels in the bathroom, but other than that I really like this place.",0
"Not that impressed.  Costs too much to wash the car, they didn't even vacuum the back and left streaks on the windows.  Won't be back.",0
I swing by because I decorate cakes. The cake decorating section is piss poor.,0
I didn't even want to go. I was so wrong! Best place I ate in Vegas.,0
It is a coffee shop. also sells yogurt. WiFi did not work. If you need your fix it is better than nothing,0
I've been here twice and really enjoy it.  Very beautiful plants and a real nice walk.  Both of my kids also enjoy it.,0
Hot and sour soup is very bitter. It is almost like it is made of pure sour. Food is decent. My husband enjoyed the rice. It was mediocre Chinese food.,0
The food was delicious I had the California Omelette I highly recommend it! The staff is very nice and attentive will definitely come back.,0
Really? Not very coupon friendly. Moved to cvs.,0
Expensive for food that is mediocre.  The wait time for the food was incredibly long and they weren't even that busy.  Lame.,0
"Simply put, This is the best Chinese-fare in the city.Served fast and hot by attentive Wait Staff.",0
"Looking for a non commercial place too get wings while visiting Vegas, a server at our hotel recommend this place. Wings were good, crispy, not that frozen packed your texture..sauce was good though I like a little more heat",0
"Dinner with four Hall of Famers sitting around me...Nolan Ryan, George Brett, Joe Morgan and Ken Griffey Sr., not bad, but the food was really good.  A nice surprise on the West Side!",0
I simply cannot review this place because it's too amazing.,0
I avoid this place!  They play extrememly loud music on Saturday nights till 2am. I will not go there until they change their practices.,0
I still can't get a handle on this place.  Depending on the time of day you seem to attract either mostly elderly alcoholics or douchebags from the suburbs.  Where are the hipsters?,0
"The food was pretty decent, but the waitresses were inattentive. No ambiance. Good green tea. They tried to commit our order to memory, which was a colossal failure. Both orders were slightly wrong.",0
"Great for breakfast. Quick, nice portion size, good quality. Home fries made to order, good wheat toast not made with crappy bread. Very clean too. Not crazy about styrofoam plates & cups.",0
"Zen 32 is terrible. In every aspect. The sushi is fishy, it's too crowded, and the servers are rude/clueless/slow. \n\n'nuff said.",0
random confession #58239:  I daydream about their ropa vieja.,0
I love the chicken parmigiana  here. It tastes just as good as more expensive places but 1/2 the cost. Salads are fresh and my kids love the pizza. This is a hidden gem. Service is always good.,0
"Pretty expensive, but the flavor can be improved much. The salmon smells weird.",0
Horrible breakfast service.  We didn't get served any drinks until our meal ended and our waiter moved us in the middle of our meal.  The coffee tasted like instant and orange juice seemed a little sour.,0
Crazy that I feel a tire shop has the Best customer service! The prices are comparable but I have found some better deals at Costco sometimes.,0
It's fast and it's just OK Chinese food.  You can do better.  I think PF Changs blows this away - but in a pinch it will work.  Experience it once and see for yourself.,0
"Haven't been to Subway in a while, but boy have they gotten skimpy on the fillings. I realize they are cheaper than other sand which places, but I would rather pay a little for a sandwich that actually has substance.",0
Total Packer Bar!\n\nThis place has become the default Phoenix bar for cheering on the Packers.\n\nEvery TV (and there are many) is tuned to the Pack on Sundays!,0
Great Store.  The amount and the variety of stock is awesome.  Easily one of the best crystal/rock shops I have seen in my travels.,0
We have been eating at Jo Jo's for 7 years. By far one if the best Pizza's in the Phoenix area. We usually do take out and if its late a delivery they never disappoint!,0
Amazing 7 course tasting meal but pretty expensive.  $125 fixed price so with 5 was quite pricey.  However food was amazing and staff were top notch!  Will go back!!,0
Wait and see! Just turn my car in to them!,0
"Rathole. I like dive bars, but some basic cleanliness needs to be observed. They do have a good beer selection, which is what got them the second star from me, but I will not be returning.",0
"Amazing service every time I go, food is very good too!",0
"Although the price of the food and service was great, the taste of the food was just okay. The menu was extensive but what I ordered was nothing special.",0
"Great BBQ, Sauce is great, Cole slaw is good, no complaints for me. It's a BBQ shack, so anybody expecting frills will be greatly disappointed. It's all about the food and that is great.",0
"I had a great time here last night. Good beer selection and tasty food. I had a watermelon beer which was really delicious, the nachos are great as well. I am looking forward to coming back for more.",0
"This place used to be good and I was disappointed the last time I went. Soggy fried rice, the waitress didn't ask us how the food is, I hope they shape up.",0
"Security here is an absolute joke. Pushing innocent bystanders into the \""pit\"" when their doing nothing but standing still. Isn't security supposed to protect not cause harm to their attendants? Would rate lower than 1 star if possible.",0
horrible dumb people when calling.  Walmart isnt annoying if you help yourself but even the asst manager courtney is an idiot,0
Blech. Was in desperate need for light asian food and quick service for lunch. Got neither. Low grade japanese food summarizes it all.,0
A must have is the lobster and shrimp mac & cheese!!\nIt is amazingly delicious. Warm and perfectly mouth watery,0
"Food is over priced and not special at all. Definitely a \""Meh.. Ive experienced better\""",0
"Worth the experience but average ice cream, ambiance and service.",0
"Good services and products.   Only one bad experience, but they fixed it.",0
Came back again but the noodles in the pho were overcooked this time\nThe thai tea also had a bad batch of boba\n\nHowever their gui cuon and the peanut sauce were pretty terrific,0
Awesome bargains and prices! I have found a new shopping spot without having to feel guilty.,0
"I don't recommend this place. Food was medium at best, the service was terrible. And the price was $155.00....you do the math.",0
"The store is really fun, just know it gets crowded quickly, especially around the holidays. Don't recommend going with a stroller in tow!",0
"The cheesesteak was edible. The service was grumpy. \n\nThis is Oakland we're talking about, so no surprises there. \n\nI give it 2 greasy stale buns out of 5.",0
Don't go out of your way to get there because they probably won't be open. They were closed early the last two times I went there.,0
Best sauce on a pizza I have ever tasted.  There sandwiches are to die for....,0
pretty high turnover of furniture and housewares.  still looking for a bookshelf.,0
Friendly service. We were the only customers so service was good. Food was good and cheap. left happy!,0
"Love the flavors and the food! Decent prices, recommend to everyone",0
"An excellent restaurant. Quality of food is high. Imaginative menu. We have eaten here before and will do so again. Well run and well managed, but hectic before AZ.",0
"Looking for a new nail place, this was convenient. Very average job though. Got a pedicure. People not that friendly. Place looked average clean. I decided not to get nails done there and probably will not go back.",0
Over priced and not any better than other Chinese places in the area.,0
"Cool, casual service and the home of probably the best cornbread I have ever had in my LIFE. In my view, you can't go wrong with Mert's. Happy eating!",0
I love Four Peaks.\nThe Grill in North Scottsdale is much closer to my house than the Tempe Brewery and it is air conditioned. It's the best place to go in the summer to get your Kilt Lifter.,0
Its what you would expect. Old world charm with new cuisine. Always elegant and great service a new york classic! I usually frequent more trendy dining establishment but visit the historic sites are just as good.,0
If you haven't been here drop everything and go.  Great food at a reasonable price!  Plates big enough to share or have the next day,0
I've been here a few times while visiting family in AZ.  The services are very modern as compared to other Catholic services I have been to.  It appears that the Church itself is pretty up-to-date with technology.,0
"I have been eating here for years, people are great and I've never had a less-than-excellent plate! Great amount of food in the bento box!",0
"Solid dogs, ESP if you are a dog fanatic. Gravy Fries are awesome. I have lunch here everyday I am in Pittsburgh. Much better than Franktuary.",0
"I didn't expect to see Chumlee or anything but did expect some cool antiques. I did not see any cool antiques. Kinda depressing overall, as was Vegas in general.",0
"Their live music on Sunday night's is great! The staff is always nice and the park is clean and kept up well, which I always apprecaite. They are dog-friendly as well, so furbabies are welcomed!",0
Fair. Honest. that is hard to find in a mechanic. Knowledgeable,0
Waited for 20 for an average breakfast burrito. Average at best. Definitely nothing special about this place.,0
Service wasn't good. Our waitress seem over worked and under extreme pressure. The manager did not address our concerns. I will not return to this location.,0
Can't miss stop for the best Fish Sandwich in Pittsburgh.,0
This review is for the buffet only!   The pasta is what has kept me from  coming back every time I am in Las Vegas!  Keep up with all the good works...Chefs....,0
The food was descent especially the pretzel bites! Service was ok at best.  The bathroom was dirty and unattended to.  Just didn't seem like the place was run well.,0
The room was clean but very small. Looks like the rooms could use some updating. The staff was very courteous and accommodating. The workout area was extremely small and only has 4 cardio machines.,0
"Food was amazing.  There was lots, but quality did not suffer.  Wait staff professional and helpful.  I can't wait to take my wife and family!",0
This place Phokin stinks... Bad odor in the restaurant.  Service is bad! Staff makes you feel  pressured to get out. Food was not great... I'll  never  come back,0
"Pretty awesome Globe, AZ inspired Mexican food. It's not as fancy as a corporate joint but the food there in delicious. And they always have country music on. Which I appreciate! Order the #1 combo. Tamales are great",0
Don't use these guys unless you make an appointment with the dispatcher.   Made arrangements with two different drivers and both times I was stood up.\nWould never use them again.,0
"The pretzels didn't look so fresh, and the shift leader has an attitude.",0
"This place is good, service is good, pizza is good. The price is ok, the building is getting a little worn down. \n\nThere is only an outside table to eat there. Nothing inside.",0
The place is nice and Big! lots of seating space with a few comfy seats such as lazyboy style seats. In a really cute house looking thing. The service is ok. A little more friendly would really make this place pop.,0
We have had dinner here twice now and both times the food was very good as was the service. We can recommend this restaurant!,0
Took my grandmother there for brunch while she was in town. It was a bit busy but overall the service was good. I had this pumpkin spice pancake with cinnamon apples on top that was out of this world!,0
Awesome! I did not expect to have such a pleasant experience at a tire place. They were helpful anf quick. Every one was smiling and said hello. Great service. And they match any price.,0
Dr. Cohen is a fantastic Doctor who I'd highly recommend!! Checked my eyes and my contacts and made slight corrections to my contacts and I was on my way.,0
The drive through service here leaves something to be desired.  Not only was my order wrong but the lady was very grumpy.,0
"A great, no frills, clean, cheap, free coffee place to stay. Newly renovated. Great location in downtown Phoenix. We were in room 217.",0
Customer service in the pharmacy is terrible there's no follow through on prescriptions or orders or call the doctors I always have some issue with picking up my prescriptions and today I went there to go through the drive thru and it's closed,0
What's not to love about Trader Joe's? Everyone who works there is really pleasant and their produce and other items are great and reasonably priced. Their Salad mixes are awesome and are what I'm currently hooked on.,0
dirty hotel inside n out.  Many people walking around outside n hanging around.  Less than a quarter of a roll of tp when we arrived and WE KILLED 4 COCKROACHES!!!  never again will we stay here!,0
"My wife and I visited this museum and enjoyed the various exhibits.  It would be a good rainy day activity and, no doubt, best enjoyed to children.",0
Ordered days in advanced to have it done by a specific time and there was a 10 minute delay.  A dozen people came in after me and had speedy service I definitely won't be going back. Ill stick with papa John's.,0
The location is not fancy at all... but this is top-notch thai food!  And the owner is a bit of a comedian.  Good dining experience!,0
"Great place for live music. Excellent selection of local beers on tap, friendly staff.",0
"I work no more than 5 minutes  from this location and love their happy hour specials! Only complaint is the super slow service when sitting outside on the patio, otherwise the food and drinks are great!",0
"Prices have increased severely.  Service has decreased.  Food not as high quality as I was used to.  I still like this restaurant, but they do need to improve to their former standards..",0
They have a nice dining area but I have to say their food isn't up to par. I recommend The Big Fat Greek restraunt on tatum & shea,0
Worst service.  Dirty.  Slow.  Ignorant by the strictest definition.  Do not go here.  Bad!  Real bad.,0
Ate here all the time at u of Pitt. Love it. Better than philly cheesesteaks and I lived near Philly for a few years. Don't walk run to uncle Sam's.,0
I like Wal Mart. I really do. Just not this one. I feel like I need to take a shower after I'm done shopping here.,0
Great Mexican food. Really yum as my husband says. There are almost none choices for vegetarian.,0
C concourse has no internet signal.  Anyone interested in a hot dog eating contest at Nathan's? No waiting.,0
Very good food! Their service was awesome and im from california! Definitely will come back.,0
"My husband and I both ordered pasta, and we both ended up with food poisoning, the sauce was super salty and, something was cross contaminated or under cooked for as sick as we both ended up.",0
"Nice try, but nothing memorable or worth going back for.",0
"I absolutely love this place. The food is delicious, great quality fish, and the staff is friendly. The atmosphere is great too. This is my favorite sushi place in town right now.",0
"This is the same format as the normal Kohl's, but the merchandise was set up a little messy especially in the accessories area.  =(",0
I don't think you press some white processed substance into a 9 iron shape and call it shrimp. Can someone send this to a lab or something? I need to know what I ate!!,0
"I want to like it more, I really do.",0
Nice hotel.  Reasonably priced and away from the chaos of the strip and downtown.  I really liked it.,0
The food is actually pretty decent but the customer server is nil,0
"i like their consistent in customer service, which is why i prefer Smith over any other local supermarket",0
The chicken caesar sandwich was very good! This is about as tasty as a gyros place can be.,0
No reason to eat this with so many other choices in the area.,0
Do not get the buckwheat noodles here.\n\nSo not authentic and a lot of the stuff doesn't taste good.\nSpend your money somewhere else.,0
"First visit today--and I loved it! Great Americano, and barista was super friendly and fast. Will be back.",0
Went here for lunch today and it was good! I got a cheese steak with fries and drink. It's was pretty standard fries were kind of bland. I liked the cheesesteak tho! May be returning!,0
"This place is disgusting!!!! The food is not appetizing at all, I was not happy with anything from this place. The service was horrible. I'm surprised they're still open. Definitively NOT coming back here",0
"This place is awesome. Nothing fancy, on the expensive side, but very chill and laid back atmosphere. \nGood food, good wine, fun crowd.",0
"Good breakfast spot off central. Eggs sloppy in a good way, toast is on point. Great service!",0
"I got Nachos that look like a bird crapped on it, the chips were limp and soggy.\n\nThe beans were bland. \n\nPretty disappointed.",0
A surprisingly classy and well-stocked collection. Props!,0
"This is a comic book store.  Great people who are very knowledgeable about past, present, and near future comics.  Always helpful and willing to find what you want.",0
The quality of the sashimi has been very poor the last few times we visited Shogun. We used to go once  a week but  it is doubtful if we will return anytime soon after three or four disappointing meals.,0
Course was in terrible shape. Paid $30 to hit off dirt fairways. Don't waste your time at this course.,0
"After sitting at our table for 30 minutes and not getting any service, we left.  But not before the hostess said thanks for coming in. Needles to say I will not be returning.",0
Small bowling alley (30 lanes). It was a lot of fun they had good pizza.  We were there for a company party which they were able to accommodate pretty well.,0
"Worst dumplings I've had in my life. The skin is so thick, and the filings fall out like a rock.  I can make playdough dumplings that taste better than this.",0
"Always come here for the night special. Salmon kama, black sausage, fried rice, spicy tuna, Kalbi sticks, Lisa Lisa role, kamikaze, lasagna roll n top off with tempura ice cream.",0
Just a good ol' American breakfast with hearty portions and good presentation - not to mention delicious!  Love the hash browns with grilled onions... oh so GOOD!!,0
Place is dirty.  Both bathrooms were out of order.  Young lady was very nice.  Will not go back.  Placed smelled like industrial cleaner.,0
Used to be great place. Food is horrible now. Doesn't feel fresh and soup had a smell. Chicken and beef cold inside and all saggy.,0
Still waiting for business to honor their commitment and return B. Makousky designer purse lost or replace with check,0
As good as it gets!  Ask for Anna she does an incredible manicure and pedicure.  Very relaxing.,0
I always have a splendid time at Postino. The food is wonderful and usually comes out pretty quickly. Fun atmosphere and I love the historic building.,0
