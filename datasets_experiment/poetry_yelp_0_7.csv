A nice quiet airport with plenty of shopping. The womens restroom has a bathroom attendant and is very clean,0

Great service. Great food and never ending sodas.,0
Excellent service and a cute little place in historic Glendale. Beautiful little tree-lined street and a lively patio. I had the tomato mozarella sandwich and tomato noodle soup. Both were very good. I'll be back for lunch.,0
The doughnuts were dry. They weren't superior to any other doughnut shop. \n\nApple fritter was good but left a coating of fat on my tongue.,0

My technician was both professional and personable.  Very easy and satisfying experience with Safelite.,0

The worst delivered pizza every half of it was missing cheese and the slices weren't  even cut properly! Never again,0
Food was very good and consistent with the other times we've eaten at Roy's in other cities. But the wait for the food took a LONG time! This restaurant is located inside the Marriott resort. Beautifully decorated with indoor and outdoor seating.,0
I thought the pizza was a little too oily. It wasn't bad though.,0
Kinda shady and is totally dead till way late...,0
Very nice clean park with awesome little league baseball fields. Bathrooms on sight. Running trail leaves from here and runs along the wash.,0
Jen and Tom run an immaculate shop and work very hard to please the customer.   I have been a client for 8 years....they are extremely good at their profession and so easy!!!,0

Don't even....NO!  Words cannot really describe the lunch buffet.  The parking lot is empty for reason...enough said!,0
"The ruebans are decent, but not worth the 12.50 they charge.  Service is great though.",0
"Passing by we stopped in for a quick slice of pie to fortify us for our continuing journey. Not disappointed, the pie was delicious!  some seriously good Jam and a very keen and friendly owner.",0

Went for dinner and food was not good.,0
Horrendous customer service. I've seen the sales associates behaving very rudely to customers. And don't even think about using them for passport photos. Every attempt was rejected by the passport office.,0

I thought that the kitchen was very clean. The food was good and fresh!!,0
The worst most over breaded oysters ever...It's a dive to boot.,0
It was ok.  Not as fancy as it sounded on the website.  The service was decent.  I would have figured the server would have asked what wine I'd like with my steak but the subject never came up.,0
Pretty darn good overall. The garlic bread was AMAZING. The pasta was better than average. The decor was nice and comfortable. Looking forward to coming back soon.,0
The price is increased but the steak size is reduced. Disappointed.,0
"They have a pretty good selection of cigars, but they are pricey.  There are better prices at almost any other smoke shop in the area.",0
I went back 2 months ago and was not happy. The ramen was so bland and the cost did not help me keep the food down :(,0
The food is borderline gross but the pie is amazing!,0
This used to be cool place with good food. Now sushimi with slice of lime is called ceviche....ahhh,0

"Grade: C\n\nThink about it. Italian food in Verona, WI... Yeah. The bartendresses are the hottest in Dane County. This is worth the trip out to Verona.",0

"Went there once a few months back, saw not one but two large roaches on the floor. That was enough for me to cancel my order and never return.",0

I highly recommend the beef bowl entree and iced almond milk tea if it's your first visit and don't want to get something you're unsure of. The brick toast is also something yummy to try out.,0

Try the Chicken Cacciatore!! Its good!!!,0
Good steak good service just what you expect when you come here,0
The pharmacy staff is the best. They remember you and do what they can to help if there are problems. Pearl and Wayne (pharmacist) and some of the best people.,0

Never get my online order in less than an hour. I'm done!,0
This place is a hidden treasure. I have visited quite a few times and have yet to be disappointed. The steak is delicious and the sides have great flavor. A great value for the quality of food.,0
Desert was great - beer was good.  Food was under seasoned a bit with out the sauce.  Husband liked it with.,0
Gross... the only great thing about my meal was the chedder biscuits. I knew by the look of my meal when it came to the table I was going to get food poisoning. I WAS RIGHT.,0
"Little slice of Vegas with slot machines throughout the airport. As a non-smoker, I found the smoking lounges a turn off as smoke poured out when I walked by. Not a bad place for a layover.",0
"Stale cone, asked for chocolate sprinkles, and got rainbow.",0
"Some of the highest quality and best Chinese food you'll find in the area, but with a price tag. This is a place to head to celebrate, not to consistently order out.",0
It's a Super Wal Mart in Scottsdale... What else need be said!,0
Fast and friendly. Couldn't ask for more.\n\nWhy aren't there more coffee shops around here?!,0

"So yummy & so fast! House special chicken & orange chicken are my favorites. Plus they use all white chicken breasts. I love that \""spicy\"" dishes can be ordered a little more mild; satisfies the entire lunch group dining together.",0
Yes it's a chain and serves non authentic Chinese. Yes it is pretty good. Happy hour has some pretty solid deals.,0

Great place to find inexpensive delicious food in Vegas.  Plus they are open till at least 3 am.,0
Even with appointment had to wait 4 hours to see the one and only doctor on site. What a mess!,0
...and this chit-hole is still open??  WHY???  Must be so the gang-bangers have a place to conduct target practice.,0
I tried their Pumpkin Ale Beer last night it was really good! Pizza was good!,0
Probably the worst run business I have ever dealt with in my entire life.,0
This museum appealed to both the casual anthropologist and the photographer in me. Very educational both inside and out. It is a relay race of science and mystery.,0

"Great deep dish pizza, great salads. Deep dish always hits the spot.",0
I ordered the Jasmine green milk tea with boba. It was very thick and had way too much milk. I wouldn't recommend getting their milk tea drinks.,0

"Didn't think this was possible, but it's worse than Olive Garden...food was horrible and extremely overpriced, service was decidedly lacking....  Neat location with fun and interesting decor but I wouldn't eat there again.",0
Absolutely the worst mexican food we have ever had. Meat was pre-cooked and reheated in the microwave. Owner lied when asked about the microwave. Do not ever eat at this restaurant.,0

I found this dentist about 2 yrs ago. He is a great dentist - a nice guy - and good conversation between numbing and drilling (lol).,0

I called to ask if they buy swords.. And the guy hung up on me. How rude.,0

Yet another sports bar that's on campus.  Don't get the  mushroom soup here even though it sounds awesome!,0
"Absolutely love Paradise Juice. Their immunity juice and all green juice are probably my favorite. Helpful staff, quick service, never had an issue here. They use the freshest ingredients and their food looks amazing too.",0
Nice building and clean. Cheap but very little soap in the high pressure soap mode. I won't be back,0

The guys working here seemed very bothered I wanted to purchase a smoothie.  Very unfriendly!!,0
Good Food but terrible service.\n\nWaiters are always very rude and short.\nthey need an attitude adjustment!!\n\nwould get five stars if they had better service,0
"Food is great, service is a little slow, sometimes painfully slow when it's lunch time.",0
"I love the atmosphere here, it's very chill. Their coffee isn't bad and the service is pretty good. Also, they are open \""late\"", so that's an added bonus if you need to make a coffee run at 11 at night",0
Sorry to break to you but  it seems another Village  inn has bitten the dust...,0
"If you're seeking bland, salty, Chinese food where every entree tastes exactly the same as the other...this is your place!",0

A fun dive bar with decent enough good and reasonable drinks.,0
It took almost 2 hours for lunch for a family of four.  \n\nI've wasted enough of my time with Coco's.  So this is the end of my review.,0
I will NEVER return to this establishment for my manicure. The service was very poor. I also witnessed one of the nail technicians (male) yelling at a customer. Very unprofessional and rude.,0
Pay attention to customers instead of talking as they are obviously waiting for you at the counter.......,0
Nice staff!   FYI military discount not given at this location.,0

"Excellent food, great beers, unique atmosphere... that pretty much sums it up. Definitely worth the visit.",0

Great bar food. Friendly staff. Alcohol :D,0
The food quality and selection were not good.  The desserts looked as if they had been prepared by Wal-Mart.  I will not be going back for seconds.,0

So surprised by the reviews -- we have used Pony Express to mail packages over 2 dozen times since 2013.   They have been absolutely wonderful - prepaid or not.  Always professional and prompt.,0
"Worst McDonald's ever bad costumer service cold burgers cold fries the manager lady is the biggest B**** I have meet,  the people that work there are slow and dumb I think I rather drive out of my way than come here.",0
The pawn shop just has a bunch of crap and the staff is rude and stupid. It is not nearly ad interesting as it is on tv,0
The food is delicious enough to eat every last bite of the large portions. Can't get enough!,0
Food was really good! Service was awful! It's a seat yourself kind of place. The guy that came in behind us got his meal before we got our chips & salsa... He had a different waitress.,0
"The food is so bad. I tried 2 times with 2 different dishes, and couldn't finish either time :(",0
"Food was OK prices were outrageous combination plates are an average 10 dollars, if you want cheese tack on more money. Been there done that won't return......",0
"Horrible sight lines, small uncomfortable seats... This place is obsolete.  Awful.",0
"They have great crab cakes here, the sauce comes with it is awesome......but the other food is just so so...",0

Great customer service and good selection of grains and yeast.,0
"The free wifi rocks here. And like the other reviewers, not too crowded and a lot of charging stations in the southwest terminal!",0

"The food was good, however, 11 (and counting) of our 23 are now sick from food poisoning.",0
"Every time my boyfriend and I eat here, it has been great. We really enjoy the steamed dumplings and hot and sour soup. The staff is very friendly, too.",0
"Haven't been to Subway in a while, but boy have they gotten skimpy on the fillings. I realize they are cheaper than other sand which places, but I would rather pay a little for a sandwich that actually has substance.",0
"Ironworks is a great spot after a nice 18 holes.  Exactly what you would expect, but a gem in the middle of the North Valley.",0

"This is a cool place with a great beer selection and it has a ton if potential to b a great spot - it's a bit pricey for it's out of date decor, filthy bathroom, and sticky tabletops.",0
The place was decent and so was the food.  I especially liked the potato salad as a side dish.,0

"Strong beers and big burgers.  Love \""The Bratzel\""  a burger topped with a brat.  Be sure to try it with the pretzel bun!",0
The bar was okay but the comedy show was horrible.,0
The food was A-Okay. The winner here are the pies! So many to choose from all of them homemade. I give an extra star for that and also the customer service is great too. Everyone is so helpful and friendly.,0
It's Vegas and I would expect a more classy airport.  But it does what it is suppose to do.,0
The service is always great not to mention the quality of food never changes... Totally worth every penny,0
This is heaven for steak lovers like me! High quality and moody...I enjoyed my time very well.,0
"Meh. The bread was cold, the bean dip it's served with was cold, the mushroom dish that was described as served over risotto was served over cold orzo. Didn't knock my socks off.",0
Your only choice for movies if you're on the east side.  Older theater shows the current films but don't expect anything extraordinary from here.,0
The architecture was gorgeous. Building is quite pretty and modern. I can't help but feel that there isn't much to see inside though. There were nice exhibits but it could have been a lot better if they added more substance.,0
Really greasy but if that's what you're looking for it tastes quite good!!,0
"Fries are AMAZING, and the steak and egg is pretty good.. a lot of food for the $$",0
"This place is old, furniture is ugly, rooms are dark and smelly. Add to that the manager was really rude... this was the worst part of the phoenix trip for me.",0
Great bread bowls. The wraps were awesome too. This is the only place in the valley that I know of that sells bread bowls.,0

"I haven't had anything here that I didn't want more of! The BEST onion rings, hands down. I've yet to take a friend here who didn't love it.",0
The golf course is overpriced for the condition of the course.  I will not play this course again.  The greens are terrible and fairways are weedy.,0
20 damn minutes waiting for lumber to be cut. So employee finally meanders over and grabs the good looking lady's lumber to cut first who just arrived. Now I get attitude. Grrr.,0
Drive through... check.\nItalian sausage... check.\ndipped... double check.,0

The service was excellent. My salmon was cooked to perfection.This is a great place to get Northern Italian food.,0
BOTTOM LINE: I love the soup & sandwiches. I can bring my dog.,0

"Our go-to restaurant, where the food and service are always excellent.",0
"I've never seen anything more ghetto in my life. Walmart is already disgusting, well times that by 3.6 million and you have the Nellis location. iky",0
"Horrible service, old flowers.  Tons of swearing and screaming coming from the back room, very unprofessional.",0
Foul tasting chicken. I don't know what else could make me so sad.,0
One of the BEST Hawaiian style places I've been to since I left Hawaii. I always make it a point to stop by here when in Vegas!,0
Really good deep fried fish that is breaded on the spot. Tastes fresh. Potato salad is very good.,0
This place is horrible. The service is second rate and the estimates are through the roof. A poorly run company by poorly organized people,0
This is our go-to pizza takeout.  The wings are nicely sized and always loaded with sauce.  The pizza is always tasty with a crispy crust.  Giant pizza and loads of wings at a great price.,0
"Fairly good service, excellent wings as usual, and a decent selection of brew. All in all not the best location, but still pretty good.",0
"The food was good. The music sucks! The service was very, very slow. There are more employees than customers while we were there, but strangely very, very slow.",0

"The Lasagna is amazing.  However, I am not impressed with the pizza or salad.",0
"Love their Pizza Nortena. That's the only thing I get because I feel like I am depriving myself if I don't. If you have never tried it, TRY IT!!!",0
"The duck taco's are amazing, THE best thing there. It's a little pricey and it's decorated like my aunts house from 1992, but otherwise a really nice experience.",0
THis place has great wings and its a cool hole in the wall type feel.  You can tell this place has its regulars as the servers knew people by name.  I will definitely be back for more wings and cocktails!!,0
10% discount for being in the union. Not too shabby. Good selection of shoes for the working man.,0
"Large resort in the desert. Great pool area, with the chairs that have flags to raise to get service. Plus it's pet friendly.",0
Are you kidding? The food was below average and overpriced and there were flies buzzing around the salsa bar.  You have got to go to Carolina's on Cactus Rd. and Cave Creek.,0
"Basic simple food, very inexpensive, but good. Great value. Bring cash, they don't take cards.",0
"Great food.  Great service.  Great people.  Great Value.\nBest sausage, peppers and onions around!",0
Good salad bar. The rest of the menu is just OK. Rouben and the courier burger are among their best.,0
"They had a 3hr window and never showed, when I called they didn't seem interested in my business",0
do not use these people to finance  your vehicle.  They do not fully disclose fees and terms and when you get to the end of your loan you will have a surprise.  Unethical,0
"I had the Italian jombot here it was so good, and the service was awesome!!! I will definitely be back.",0
"The menu is fun, the food was great and the service was super.  Can't wait to visit again!",0
The best pizza in the great state of Arizona! Enough said,0

Pretty bad. Wow. Marriott should be embarrassed.,0
Great food.amazing meatballs. Awesome portions for the price. Service left something to be desired,0
Mystery Theater was cute and funny. Food was aweful and very bland.,0
The only reason this gets 2 stars is because my kids love this place. The pizza is Terrible. The games pretty crappy and run down many of them not working properly.  Why can't places for kids serve better quality food?,0
Tried the BBQ ribs and the chicken sate. Sate was very good. The ribs were a little too chewy for me. All in all it was pretty good.,0
Worst service ever. \nFood/tea is mediocre to terrible. \nNot sure how this place stays open.\n\n...Best thing about this TS is the outside seating and location.,0
"The food is run of the mill Mexican food - decent and filling. However, the service is slow. The waitresses are friendly, but a weekday lunch with few customers should not take an hour.",0
"Ceasar salad was great, but adding chicken cost $6. Very pricy.",0
Great food and great prices!! My favorite is the green curry.,0
"This is the most confusing airport I have ever been in, I just wanted to kill things by the time I mad e it out.",0
Stopped in for fun. I'm not familiar with pawn shops but I was expecting items to be priced under retail. These items are used right? TVs and other electronics were the same price as brand new. \nI'll pass...,0
"Wow!  It really was very, very good.  The server was a little weird but overall everything was peachy!",0
Old school greasy spoon food and very nice service. It's a throwback to another time and a good one at that.,0
Check them out on Ch 5's Dirty Dining 11/7/13. You be the judge.,0
I'm a New Yorker and it's been hard finding a pizza place that is like home. While it isn't completely NY style pizza it's pretty close.,0
"Mordechai and his son, Benny, are so nice and hospitable. They great you with a smile and do whatever they can to make you happy. I feel completely satisfied when I leave. Thank you",0
This place used to be the go to spot. Real Solid for the most part. Now the food is horribly bland and the egg rolls have some spice in them that is super nasty.\n\nSad,0
Can't go wrong with shepherd's pie and a Guiness.,0
"Hole in the wall restaurant, went here for the lunch buffet, and really did not like the food, it was very dry and did not have any flavor, staff was rude, won't be back, and you shouldn't go either.",0
Would not recommend this salon to minorities because of racist workers. I love the clients at the salon but behind the scenes its very unprofessional and unsanitary however I still wish Peter and Holy much success in all they do.,0
It's like they took all the worst employees at surrounding fast food restaurants and stuck them here. They've gotten one out of 5 drive through orders right. Don't go here,0
"A huge Albertson's.  A bakery, deli, prepared foods, Starbuck's and floral.  It is gigantic inside.",0
"An amazing and unique botanical garden. There are a lot of botanical gardens in the us but none quite like this which showcases how beautiful, colorful and full of life the desert really is.",0
Has needs - trash cans - benches - amphitheatre,0

This was the worst del taco ever! The chips in the nachos were totally stale. The fries were cold and the service was VERY mediocre! Being from out of town and getting such poor food was SO DISAPPOINTING!,0
For Taiwanese style of breakfast.  The  seasamebaked bun is as hard as a stone.  Disappointed!,0
The donuts were fresh and delicious. The apple fritter was perfectly cooked. The cake donuts were a magical blend of crispy and moist. My kids approved of the chocolate frosting.,0
"Great thin crust pizza, good local brews on tap. Would have given this another star if it wasn't for the 90 min wait for a table.",0
Never...ever...again. There is too much other good food around town.,0
"Check the expiration dates! This location is notorious for having expired stock. It's poorly staffed & the few times I've brought expired items up front, I've been confronted with staff that were not the least bit interested. I avoid shopping here.",0

The best grilled chicken and ribs in town.  Favorite sides are the chicken pasta salad and steamed veggies. YUM!!!,0
"Sunday Brunch was really nice.  Not over the top, but well worth the $13.  Will go again.",0

"Love the midwest best sammie on garlic bread. I wish they had more drink options, but other than that I love the taste.",0
This place has great choices for healthy food. It's very neat and clean inside and the service was very quick. We had a group of 12 people and they sat us promptly and the food came just as fast. I highly recommend this place.,0
"This place keeps it simple.  Only a few things on the menu, but it's all delicious!  Right next to lux, so you can get an iced chai with your tomato/mozzarella sandwich.  Yum!!!",0
"I was here last night for the Mosaik ballet.  Gotta love this old, nicely restored theatre.  It's a classic and I enjoy attending performances here every time.",0
"Love this place, they are good about describing the different kinds of sushi if you wanna try something different.  any time we have company we go here for your sushi.",0
Fantastic food!  Cool atmosphere. Seems to be pretty popular. Small place. Great selection. Sauces are fantastic!  Might be some of the best food I have ever had!  Would go here again in a heartbeat!,0

"perfect european portions, tasty food, true italians (still speak italian). i love it here, too bad my waistline would expand entirely too much....",0
"The beer was cold and really good (Spotted Cow...must try it if you haven't), the food was great (and cheap) and it's just a great bar to hang out in.",0
Good food but the young staff can never get any to go order right. They are too busy talking about their social life,0
This place is good. The pho is great. It's clean and the service is great. Spring rolls are worth a try too and the ice coffee.,0
My first time at this East Valley institution...had the lamb tongue sandwich...tasty!,0
"Divey hole-in-the-wall, but Salem's has the best damn gyro in the city!  I stumbled upon it after my dad turned me on to this place and...  so good!",0
Also subject to unannounced rate increases.\n\nPut up with it for years but will be moving out now. \n\nOver a 48% net increase over 3 1/2 years. \n\nLook elsewhere.,0
Tonight I was served a gyro which the meat was burnt with a black char on it.  I've been eating there less frequently as the quality seems to be slipping.   I will not be returning after this.,0
Food is amazing!!! And staff is ALWAYS so nice!!!,0
Andrea's friday night class is awesome. I am a fighter and i enjoy the stretch and push i get from her class. A great release with even better results!,0

"Baked apple pancake was horrible... Not worth the wait. Nothing was fresh ..,no flavor",0

Great Staff!\nGood Care.\nDirty facility and slow attention.,0
My date and I both had meals here and it was eh on service and food. I was hoping for it to be better as it's a family owned restaurant but it was not meant to be,0
This is a Kewl place.. They have really good drinks here,0
The bagels are good. The sandwiches leave something to be desired in the taste department and the coffee is over roasted. Everything is a bit over-priced for what you get. I have never had a problem with the customer service.,0
"Lots of containers and vessles for your weed, clothing made from weed, signs and posters with weed topics.  This is your familiar college town head shop.  Nothing has changed.",0
"This was a great little find! The staff were lovely and the menu is expansive, but full of great options. Our food was delicious and the portions were perfect for the price.",0
"Definitely a great little spot for lunch or dinner. The appetizers, some of them, are big enough to have as a meal.",0
Worth a stop but not a return.  2 1/2 stars.,0
"Great food at reasonable prices. Not the most comfortable seating and the tables are crammed together pretty tight, but again the food is worth the trip.",0
Get the daily pasta special.. Can't beat it. Skip salad and dessert-won't have room,0

The room was kind of clean - I found a pair of dirty socks and their was toothpaste/water splatter on the walls in the bathroom.,0
Sesame Inn has 4 locations. Station Square is the worst of all. I generally avoid this one but love the other 3. Still much better than most Chinese around town.,0
"The food here is delicios, but it takes forever. From the time I ordered to when I was served 25minutes. Come only if you have time to spare to sit and wait.",0
Just perfect!!!  For what it is!!!  Down to the Edison light bulbs from rejuvanation!!,0
"Very nice hotel in a great, convenient location.",0

"Kilt lifter, 8th street, Peach ale, really any beer they serve is amazing. Food is very good/great!",0
"Got an amazing assortment of pastries from here to serve at my royal wedding watching party on Friday. It was fun to eat such delicate and gorgeous creations - and they tasted delicious, too!",0
The place is beautiful and romantic. The food is so blah!,0
"I brought a pepperoni pie home from Pat's once and it was completely forgettable. The sauce was average and, like the cheese, not plentiful enough. It wasn't any better cold the next day.",0
"Nice employees, nice location, Awful sushi.  Should have known something was amiss when it was empty at 6:30 on a Friday night.  Surely there are better places in town.",0
Good location but seriously how much would it cost to put cushions in the armrests...,0
"Very well run establishment. There are no surprises, consistently great prices and good service. It is one of the last LOCAL remaining family businesses in town, and should be supported!",0
I love their menu!  The garlic mashed potatoes-amazing!  Steak-melts in  your mouth!  Service - great!  Big fan of Applebee's!,0
Love the stars!  They are the only thing affordable in this place!,0
they are less than a minute from home..\nthey have everything basically..\nno complaints :),0
Yummy authentic Mexican food with recipes that have been in the family for generations.  The flan is a must!,0

"not \""real\"" mexican food but a decent substitute in a pinch",0
Grade: C\n\nThis once classic now relies on its past. Been there. Done that.,0

"I can only speak for the lunch menu, but I found it bland and unsatisfying.  I wish I had found a Chipolte instead.  On the plus side, it was quick.",0

Simply overrated! Money well spent somewhere else! Ordered a T bone steak medium rare but got it well done. Very expensive for the quality of the food.,0
"Overpriced movies and food, its your average movie theatre really.",0
Food is great but this time I was with two other friends. Each person's plate of food came out one at a time and at 10-15 minutes apart. So we basically all ate one at a time. Very poor service.,0
"If you like dog food, then go to this lousy place for food.",0
Paid $1100 for the required course - party of 6 - and unfortunately did not come close to feeling satisfied in any regard - sorry guys - not a fan and way overpriced,0
"I hadn't been to Manuel's in years and remembered it as being decent.  I went recently and the service was poor, the food was cold and bland.  I will not go back.",0

"Great, fun atmosphere, and good food! What more could you ask for?!",0
"What a disappointment.  Terrible service, no bread until requested three times, bland unseasoned food and 16 bucks for a salad. Pass on this place. Only the valet was worthwhile.",0
"Steak was good, sides were jus O.K. The waitress was hot, that always helps. The service was excellent, the food is average and kind of expensive for what it is.",0
They have the best bathing suits here! The best brands that have great quality are found here! The staff is friendly and suggest great styles that make me look gooooood! Thanks Triangles.,0
My go to delivery Chinese spot..from that category you gotta know what to expect but the Wok definitely steps it up over any other delivery place that I know of in the area.,0
Go sit at the Bar.  The drinks are great and the SUSHI is very good.  The women in there are smokin hot.,0
"Room was big and standard. Not many towels but enough. No refrigerator. The food was meh, and drinks expensive. Girls were alright, the casino didn't smell too bad.",0
"Worst service ever, the manager was angry and screaming and was being very rude when we asked her about the meals, never going there again, she was screaming at all the waitresses.",0
Very yummy.  Great for vegetarians and non alike.,0
"Below average Mexican food at best. And $6 for chips and guacamole? Unless you go to Chandler High, skip this place.",0
It was way to cold in there. Nose was frozen. Need a winter cold or you would freeze. Theater was clean and spacious.,0
"Great small club for intimate shows.  \n\nDepending on what you order, drinks can be expensive.",0
"went back there today and asked for two simple burgers with nothing but ketchup and cheese, not hard, right? apparently it is if your english is as good as your order taking skills",0
"Food was great. Drink was questionable. Service was truly sad. I'll try it again, because I've got a $25 certificate, and the food really was that good. I'll report again after that.",0
Delivery was delivered on time when requested. Delivery man was friendly. Food on the other hand was far from statisfying. Have had better food in the past. Disappointed this time,0
Wonderful place with great food. The place could use some updating but I still like it.,0
The owner of the store made the situation right by contacting me. I wish more owners would realize this is a good way to make things right and keep customers who had a bad experience.,0
"Live music, great bruschetta, great service",0
The service was horrible and the slowest I've ever experienced. I won't be back.,0
I have been eating at Harolds for almost 15 years. I have probably eaten every item off menu. One of my favorites is the Cajun Prime Rib. Still my favorite place to go eat and hang out.,0
Solid place to grab a classic breakfast. Nice selection with seasonal choices. Had the Pumpkin Pancakes with some herbal tea.,0
BBQ was really dry and the tea was pretty stale tasting. Only part of the meal I enjoyed was the buttered biscuits. Cheap though.,0
Always a very good quanity of trucks to choose from. Quickly get you out and checked in.,0
"Really, its as good as it gets. The food is hot and fresh. The cornbread is awesome and the service is good...I love this place.",0
The front desk is rude. My appointment time was not honored and they expected me to wait over an hour. I can't say enough bad things about this doctors office. And it looks like you'll catch something in the waiting room.,0
"Great food and the service is always GREAT, however it is a bit pricey. Maybe not the best place for kids",0
Was not all the impressed by their dishes.  The one dish that stood out was the fried oysters. The XO string bean and fried rice were mediocre. Their seafood looked very good unfortunately they had run out of rock fish cod.,0
"Food great, service great, but the restaurant was filthy. Workers standing around talking while every table was dirty, floor and soda counter disgusting. I was there 45 minutes and no one made a move to clean anything.",0
"Not real impressed.  Sauce wasn't all that and sliced beef was tough. Trash can was full, restaurant wasn't real clean. Two small sandwiches and two sides came to $20.   Won't be back.",0
"Not exactly French food, but very satisfying.  Huge meatballs and a seriously tasty burger for a fair price will have my friends and I return.",0
Food and service were mediocre at best. Cost was about the same as anywhere else. Would rather go to Breakfast Club.,0
"The broadway pizza is yummy. The knots are a cheap yummy eat. $3 for 6 knots cheap, cheap!",0
"bad service, bad food, just bad all around!!",0
Very stylish restaurant with a great street view. Food can be on the spicier side here which is a plus. Worth checking out based on the price point.,0
Really nice hotel with a breakfast bar similar to a Hilton hotel.,0
Best friggin wings ever. Ask for them GRILLED after frying!,0
Airport has ample restaurant options and of course plenty of slot machines to keep you entertained while you wait for your flight.,0
This shop is lovely! If you are looking for Civil War reproduction fabrics this is the place to find them. Their selection is HUGE. The employees are sweet and very helpful.,0
Best to come and leave opposite of the mad crowd!,0
"Not a big fan of the chicken and waffles idea, but the waffles and fruit punch were good!",0
Great pizza and wings but some of the employees are rude.  Lot of good pizza in the area think I will start going elsewhere,0
Best Chinese in Phoenix hands down. The hot and spicy prawns are a must and so are the house chow fun noodles.,0
"Great job framing a canvas piece that I brought back from Panama. On time and relatively good pricing, I think. Either way I love the piece and the work they did on it.",0
I went there last night for dinner and they closed the place down!!!  I am devastated!  I loved Furr's...,0
"I tried their shrimp pasta...it was bland and had a weird taste. The service was a little slow, but friendly. The portions are good but for the price, I hoped the taste would have been a little more pleasing.",0
My wife came in for alterations and was treated quite rudely.  This kind of customer service (or lack thereof) is simply inexcusable for any business establishment.  I advise you to go elsewhere for your tailoring needs.,0
Horrible manager! She told us we only needed to wait 25 minutes and we ended up waiting an hour. She just had excuses up the wall. Thank goodness the Jack Daniels is only $3,0
"I love the bagels here. They are tasty and always taste fresh. I would eat here for breakfast every weekend if I could! \n\nHowever, some locations are better than others- they are not always consistent.",0
Delicious.  Loved the salsas as they were super fresh and you can request a spicier version.  Our dinners were just as delicious.,0
Horrible service.  Rude individuals.  They locked the doors before the business was closed so they wouldn't have to deal with complaints!,0
"Great little place. All the sushi was good, but the flying fish roe was put together loose and the eggs spilled in my soy sauce :[ but they were still good. Very friendly sushi chefs.",0
This place id FILTHY!!! All the teenies working there need to get off their phones and maybe wipe a table off? Went for a blizzard and there was not one clean table. SERIOSLY?,0
I simply cannot review this place because it's too amazing.,0
"Their patio is a nice area, wait staff was nice as well. However the food was alright, not worth the slightly elevated prices and they charge for extra chips and salsa.",0
"Nice waitresses. Fun place for old people,  food isn't special.",0
I am a fan of their pita.  It was so fresh and warm.  Excellent!  I prefer the hummus at Pita Jungle though.,0
"Food does not taste good... has a plastic aftertaste, overpriced.",0
I have gone to Gino's for years. He does a great cut. It's an old fashion barbershop including men's magazines.,0
Went during lunch time and serve was extremely slow.,0
"Service is quick and to the point, the place is full of smoke because they bbq in the restaurant need more vent.\nRare beef noodle soup is one of my favorite.",0
This restaurant really should not exist. The waiter has made a ton of mistakes and the food takes forever to come out.,0
"Great salon that is reasonably priced. You almost never have to wait. The salon has a clean atmosphere. The girls are very friendly. Lastly, the manicures and pedicures are thorough and very relaxing! Will continue to visit this salon!",0
"Great food and service, very pleased with my Valentine's day dinner here.  Planning to come back to try more of their fare, since their Valentine's day menu was limited.",0
Great prices!! Got 4 books for $20. My old bookstore would cost so much more. Love love!,0
"One of the better Chinese food restaurants in Pittsburgh. The food is pretty authentic, and while they have your standard American Chinese food, they have some genuine-tasting Cantonese dishes too.",0
"Friendly staff and nice selection of vegetarian options.  Food is just okay, not great.  Makes me wonder why everyone likes Food Fight so much.",0
"I love this spot. Good drinks decent food although I don't care for the rice at all. All the servers are prompt and friendly, I come here often",0
I stopped coming to this location because they NEVER give you napkins in the drive-thru..employees here are pretty grumpy.,0
"Great deep dish pizza, excellent bar, super service. Great place to go, a little pricey but that comes with quality.",0
Seriously you must go here if in Vegas! It's a short walk from Fremont but worth it. So much fun! Cheap prices too!,0
Great Greek food including awesome Gyros!! They also have live music here a lot which is a great escape from doing your homework!  This place gets busy as lunch because it's right by the quad!,0
"Waited 50 minutes for food, with no explanation or apology.  Rather defensive waitress offered us drink refills when one of our party complained.  \n\nWill not be stopping here again.",0
We have gone to Laredo's many times over the years. On our trip there last Wednesday night my son ordered the Rio Bravo. He was sick with food poisoning later that night and into the next day.,0
The food was extremely decent for the price.   We ordered numerous dishes and everyone seemed to enjoy them.,0
Stop here! Buy a block of the dill Havarti and try a bunch of samples. I am sure there will be others that you love :),0
great shop...manager Craig is fair and knowledgeable....saved me a bunch of money!!!\nI've had all three of our BMW's in there for service..!\n\nMike,0
Only 2 stars for location. Rooms are humid and smell like wet dog. Worst hotel I have yet to stay in as a consultant.,0
A great little place. Delicious and affordable Italian food. Great salads and pasta. Try the pizza rolls!,0
"Very good pizza!  This is usually our \""go to\"" for pizza when the kids aren't around (they prefer Pizza hut).  Pretty authentic NY Style pizza although a little bit on the pricey side.",0
"Terrible service,  the food is nothing special and it was a little pricey too.",0
"I've never actually stayed at the resort so I cannot review that, but I have eaten breakfast there several times.  The breakfast buffet is awesome.  I would recommend trying it if you ever have the change.",0
"Get the pastrami, swiss, and egg on pumpernickel. It is amazing and service is quick. Being from out of town this is so much better than Starbucks.",0
"Every time we visit Arizona we always go to Tom's. There Italian Beef is fantastic with peppers and grilled onions, makes my mouth water just thinking about it. We also had there Vienna hotdogs there great as well.",0
I was impressed they had very fresh salads and toppings. Also the baked goods and the chocolate mud cake were on point.,0
Terrible service. Love when the bartenders are drinking more than you. Not to mention harass you about playing the machines,0
"Vegas baby.....vegas.....\n\nIt's an airport. See all my other airport reviews. They are all about the same...sometimes on time, sometimes delays, sometimes long lines, sometimes not.",0
This is very near to my place. Not crowded and good place to do your quick shopping.,0
"Really fresh, unique beers. Loved the pumpkin stout.\nGood food, had the pierogies, very buttery. \nExcellent friendly service",0
"Always kinda half empty store... The one at Desert Ridge is a bit better and cleaner, Happy Valley one is good too.",0
Love the food here but the service is horrible! There doesn't seem to be any order in which section the waiters worked in. They rush us thru order.....and then u have to flag them down if u want anything else.,0
They are rude tell you nothing and just leave you there. I need to drop off my car and no one talked to me for 20 mins they.,0
The food itself is ok. The dessert is to die for and the atmosphere is awesome. A favorite place to have.dessert and wine at the end of the night,0
Great local yarn store with lots of high-quality yarns of many different varieties.  The cafe in back is nice and cozy too.,0
"Friendly staff but as some of the other reviews mentioned, tools don't appear to be sanitized for next customer. This is a shame because otherwise I was satisfied but I would rather pay more for clean /safe conditions. Too bad.",0
Shrimp few in shrimp low mein and was not very tasty. Disappointing.,0
"Food okay and staff is fairly attentive except for one short waitress who is always grumpy. Last time, she took my order wrong and didn't even apologize.",0

The airport was easy to navigate and clean. no gum on the floor. had to rock my jacket as the airport had some kicking AC going on. the people were nice,0
"We have two larger dogs and a cat which have been given good care over the years here. This place doesn't seem to do too much thats unneccessary, and not much upselling when you go in. Caring staff.",0
"The food is actually fairly mediocre.  But with an endless supply of buy one/get one coupons they distribute, it's one of those \""why not\"" sort of places for a breakfast for two.",0
Great wedding. Brittany and Brian were so cool. I loved the laughter and the spirituality. I thought Shenendoah did a good job with food and the setting was nice.,0
"The Quality is Good, the prices can be a little Steep. I lived behind this place for a year unaware it was here, might want to advertise location a little better.",0
Fairly average Italian food other than the meatballs. Too many good Italian places in Pittsburgh to choose here. Interior could use an update. Beer selection below average and nothing special happening with speciality drinks.,0
"I told him no Swiss cheese and they still made it, and they still made it with this was cheese I had to wait a second time I would recommend coming here they don't pay attention.",0
"Consulted him for setting up an estate plan.  First meeting was free, and he was informative.  We haven't made our decision yet, but he is definitely worth interviewing for the assignment.",0
Wide variety and a very friendly staff!!! Also open 24-7 always a plus...,0
Horrible service and ignored several times by the server.  Food was prepared wrong. Cold queso.. should have went to Chili's,0
"This is not pizza. This is bread with sauce on top. Just go to the supermarket, get some bread and tomato sauce and slather it on - done. Gross, don't do it. Get Ian's instead.",0
I have eaten here twice once for breakfast and once for lunch. And both times I have enjoyed the food that was made to order and the fast service. Big bonus is that Starbucks is next door. Yay!,0
"Got the creamy pesto penne pasta i added some shrimp,  absolutely delicious.",0
It's way too loud in here. I prefer the Central Ave. location.,0
"The only thing worse than the food there, is the service.  It's almost a joke how poor this place is",0
"Service at bakery checkout is terrible,  very rude and slow service.",0
The food was ok.  Service was a little slow and not very attentive.  I went with the family and the kids thought the place looked pretty cool but other than that they left saying they never wanted to go there again.,0
Good environment. A more classy Chinese food place.\nmORE Expensive but better service.\nHas authentic stuff and americanized stuff like orange chicken too..,0
This store has greatly improved customer service since my last visit. It's more adult now. Good job!,0
"Nice ambiance but a little noisy, over priced.",0
Personally to me not worth the wait outside but interesting to see it in real life. The cast was of course not there and it looks just like any other pawn shop.,0
Food was good and full of exciting flavors. Would put 3 $$$ for price.,0
Below average bagels. Eggs had no taste. Fast service.,0
Food not genuine but is reasonably good. White rice was old hard and crusty. \nI will have to find better Chinese and I will.,0
"The wings were good, but the pork porterhouse was very dry. Also, the sirloin my daughter got was cooked properly and very tough.",0
"Delicious dim sum, large variety, fast service, and decently priced. No MSG overhang afterwards.",0
They leave the roll up door between the bar and the smoking patio wide open so you can enjoy the cigarette smoke while you eat.,0
I have been a patient of Dr. Griego for 7 years.  I am 32 and have had several cases of basal cell carcinoma.  Dr. Griego is simply the best at what he does.,0
"This is a fabulous restaurant, very casual and it gets busy at lunch time but the food is amazing. I highly recommend this place for something a little different, I have been going here for more than 10 years!",0
Very clean and very good quality of produce and meat. Staff is very helpful and great. Well lit parking lot and has security. Prices are high but are ok with vons card. Very efficient and has a nice Starbucks.,0
"Awful everything. From the bad service, to the diluted soup, to the lame-no chicken on the chicken salad, to the PRE-fabricated pizza. AVOID THIS PLACE!",0
"A wise man once told me, \""Don't teach the 'gwei lo' new tricks.\""  I never understood what that meant until I ate here.",0
Good place with decent drink prices.  Wish they were open a little earlier...,0
They must have heard me!  They recovered the booths!,0

"THe food here was not good. We ordered several dishes including the dumplings, seafood, and noodles. I didnt like any of it and would definitely not go back",0

"This was a nice experience - the ambience nice, with the brick walls. The food very homemade tasting.",0
"Probably 80 percent of the time my order is correct and timely, I've rarely had a problem with this place and when I have, it doesn't bother me because it is McDonald's.",0
"Grotesque food, vulgar staff, blech.",0
Delicious! Very homely with simple dishes. Relatively priced with a good aroma. 5 stars easy.,0
"At this visit we shared orders of tender beef and shrimp along with a bountiful salad and 6 banchans.  Pak, our server, was particularly informative so we learned a little more about this cuisine than during our last visit",0
I will no longer buy bagels here anymore. No matter which kind you buy they all taste like an onion/garlic bagel...even the cinnamon sugar!,0
Delicious & unique.  You can't go wrong here.,0
"Why does yelp force us to at least give one star? Yelp should realize some places deserve a negative rating. This place is one of them. Overpriced, badly cooked.",0
"This is very cheap food - the eggs and bacon are good, veggie omelet not so much.  Service is amazing and you are really made to feel welcome - I think the better call is the pancakes or french toast.",0
"Ive never seen a Starbucks in a place that looks like a giant dining room in a house... Def quaint and cozy, staff is very nice... And. I believe it's attached to a hotel...",0
"Absolutely the nicest folks here, the service is incredible. The food is always fresh and IMO very good. I've been going here for 5 years and the experience is consistently excellent",0
$10 to go to the pirates game round trip. Very cool experience.,0

"Great for breakfast. Good biscuits and link sausages. Also I have not been disappointment with fish dishes, chicken.",0
"Squirrel Hill classic!!! \n\nIt really is excellent pizza and the sauce is so perfect! The dining area isn't anything to write home about - but the pizza is, so its all balanced!",0

Dr. Cohen is a fantastic Doctor who I'd highly recommend!! Checked my eyes and my contacts and made slight corrections to my contacts and I was on my way.,0
I've been here twice.  Food is adequate but definitely not the best.  Service is very slow.  You spend your whole lunch break standing in line.  I won't go back.,0
Delicious. Cozy atmosphere. And delightful serving woman. Very legitimately Japanese place. Great place.,0
All I need to say is Cole Haan shoes for $9.99. Oh yes I dih-id!,0
"We just moved to Buckeye, (Verrado) and was experience was awesome, Yes its in Downtown Buckeye, not a nice place to say the least, but its worth the experience.",0
Dry and bland! I could cook better at home. I've tried both the pork and brisket.,0
"Ga-ross!! I can't believe I just spent $30 here! Undercooked egg rolls, pathetic chicken lo mein and just shitty tasting food all around. I don't live anywhere near this place and I will never return.",0
Tried to make an appointment with a female doctor for my wife. Was told that as she had seen a doctor there before (over 5 years ago)  their policy was she had to see the same doctor.  Not good customer service.,0
"I freaking love it here!! This can't be missed if your around this area, try out True Food.",0
"Wow. Dirty and slow.  The floors felt like they had the days burger grease spilled all over, and it took 30 m8n to get our take out order.",0
Tried to stop for a quick car lunch on the way to court. 10 minutes later I'm trapped in line and still hungry. Slowest fast food in America.,0

"Good food... opinion finely dice your Jalepenos in your cream cheese, slices of them yuk! It wasnt spicy either... add some of the seeds.",0

"Good food, snobby staff... nothing outstanding about this place.",0
Nice place to visit in spring time frame.  The prices are affordable and the views are breathtaking.,0

I always like this place. I don't think I have ever had a bad meal here.,0
"Food was good, service was fast and friendly. BUT... place was in serious need of cleaning.",0

"Pizza is ok, sauce is kinda bland,  but these wings are not good.  Wings have the taste of old or burnt oil",0
"Do not waste your time playing this course. Looks like they gave up on maintance. Horrible conditions, bunkers don't have sand, greens are bumpy. Flag stick are broken. Spend your money elsewhere!!",0
This place rules.  Spend your money here!!!!!  Everything is cooked to perfection.  Lobster melt just changed my life.  Thank you past reviewers for bringing me here!,0
"Solid hotel, pretty hard beds but clean. Great water pressure and fantastic location.  Be sure to join their club for free in room wifi.",0
"Great food, excellent service, this will become a regular of ours!",0
Good prices but not cutting edge as far as fashion or quality of merchandise.  Lines to check out can be a little long at times.,0

The guy working the bar area was great. He was courteous and genuine. The food was good.,0
"Good beer, Wednesday night is banjo night which always draws a crowd. Definitely a hipster bar. Food is fresh & worth trying. Get a dish that includes the house humus.",0

The wings here are fantastic and the cheese sticks are absurd in a very good way. Will definitely be back.,0

Very Good Food in Generous Portions a bit expensive served by a gracious waitstaff--undermanned when we were there.,0
"A small, unassuming salon tucked into a corner of a strip mall. The prices are great ($19 for pedi) and the service is really good. A great find!",0

"You can ask to try samples! Watch out for the nuclear cherries, they're soaked in everclear!",0
Great bartender and attentive service..... but really?! Really?! No champagne on a Sunday?! What about mimosas?,0
not  very pleased 2nd time around won't return.,0
Very good for breakfast.  Good food for an excellent price.  Many regulars that make you feel like you are at a family.,0
"First off, Brake shops are probably the biggest rip-off going. I bought all the parts here and changed them myself, saving over $100 bucks at least....",0
Great place to come and have a drink and watch a few sports games or bet on the horses. They also have otb  on dog racing. The food is average bar food.,0
"KillRoy's... \""World's best Berger\"" or well now \""worlds coldest draft beer\""... RIGHT!!... They don't serve food... I don't know what else to say... FAIL!!!!",0
This airport is huge. So big that I would never want to transfer flights here with different airlines because I don't know if I would make it in time. Big plus that there is free wifi and decent food options,0
This place is a bit schizophrenic.I am staying at the hotel for a week so I am here enough to say that  they serve a good breakfast with a friendly breakfast staff.,0
"My favorite place for breakfast just about anywhere. Get an omelet (you can't go wrong with any of them), pumpkin bread, and potatoes. I moved away 2 years ago and I STILL crave Omelet House.",0
Ehhh I don't really like this place.,0
Awesome pizza & wings! Great specials and great prices.,0
Great airport. You can gamble while u wait.,0

"Typical college bar.  Have never been there at night, never want to go there at night...\n\nAverage average average.",0
Very very large  beer selection bottled and draft.  Bartender was great with explaining the beers they have. Great prices on happy hour with a good food selection.  Try a different wild game burger if you're adventurous!,0

"I really enjoy myself here. The food, the staff and the prices are all good. I do have to admit that I have only had the pizza though. They have a nice sized crowd every time I am there.",0
"Ok place, not a very good coffee. Don't let the name fool you. Their espresso is horrible. With a name like this, I expect a good quality espresso with crema.",0
Great customer service! Love the view of the mountains on the patio. Good start to anyone's morning.,0
"Wonderful atmosphere, but food is nothing special!",0
"This was a bit of a disappointment. Sushi rice was way too sweet, and the pasta was overcooked. Overall food was ok but worse than I had expected given the 4 star rating and seemingly authentic menu.",0
Great location - make sure you ask for a view of the river.  Worth the money.,0
I love the Goat Yogurt.. oh and their goats milk is the cheapest. The brown eggs are like farm eggs from home. Thank you Trader Joe's,0
Whoohoo!  My favorite Theaters!    Love the Camelview and Fashion Square locations,0
We liked the service.....sushi also fresh....steak cooked right....generally pretty good,0
"I enjoy stopping by after shooting hoops Sunday nights. The store is well ran. Clean store, fast service. No surprise that they have a line to the door at 9 pm on Sunday nights.",0
Food was ok. Big portions but way to pricy for the food quality. I did get sick after having their salmon. Not sure if it was the mic of foods or what. Most likely not going again,0
"Totally cheap, nasty, gross food! Skip this place.",0
I shopped at Pottery Barn over the 2014 Holiday Season.  The selection was top of the line. The sales associates were very helpful and courteous.  Great Staff which always helps the shopping experience.,0
So much for my previous review....expounding on the virtues of flame-broiled meat and that glorious smell it produces.\nThe place burned down last night.,0
Indi was awesome! She was very helpful & went out of her way to make sure we were taken care of.,0
Love love love this place. They did an amazing job. Favorite place for happy hour.,0
"If I can avoid flying into McCarran I will, and Henderson Executive is the place to go. Friendly staff and great location make this a great spot for ingress and egress from Sin City.",0
"Native New Yorker seemed like a place that would have awesome pizza.  We had pizza, wings, salad, and some beer.  The best part of the meal was actually the salad.  The pizza tasted fairly plan and very greasy.",0
"OK but would not choose it over other great restaurants in the area. Portions are good, but the food did not taste fresh the taquitos, were dripping from lard just not appealing.",0
Food is ok and portions are super small.  Was here for dinner but heard lunch portions are decent.,0
Service is slow in the bar area. Not many people here either.  Bartender more interested in her phone. 40 min wait for two salads.,0
Same as the other posts....Got ignored...Gear overpriced and snotty staff.  Dude you sell car stereos for a living.,0
"Very patient and nice. Some of their jewelry is affordable for the common person. I bought my girlfriend a necklace, a ring, and earrings there. Each time, I had great customer service.",0
Food phenomenal! Service can be hit or miss.,0
Had a mushroom cheese steak. Normally a very tender juicy sandwich. Not this time. Tough and dry. Trainee needs more supervision and training.,0
"Lamb was tough, chicken was dry, the sauces were too oily.  Decently flavored sauces and the soup was very nice, but I won't be back.",0
So... the building shakes consistently. This is disconcerting on a number of levels and also probably provides any number of unpleasant metaphors.,0
"Headed here yesterday in search of a food mill.  Although they didn't have one, they were super helpful in suggesting places that might.  The place is orderly, clean and the staff was very friendly.",0
A pain to get in and out of. I dread each trip I have to take to this place.,0
Great quality groceries!!! Really nice fruit and veggies and meat and everything,0
"Their food is really bland, no flavor at all! Overpriced for tasteless food! A whole in the wall place with tasteless food!",0
This place is insane there is so much stuff in this store. I couldnt belive the selcetion they have from all over the world. Their liquor section is huge. They also have this huge tank with live fish in it.,0
So I ordered a chicken plate and 10 mins later they came out and told me they were out of chicken... at 5 pm???? they owner never came over or the Manager to say anything.... I thought it was Rude!,0
The lamb kabob was cooked perfectly. Tabooleh and falafel were fantastic. Finished off with knafeh. Must try!,0
"Very cool old place in the industrial part of town.  I wish it wasn't surrounded by two strip clubs (made for interesting conversation with young kids) but the food was pretty good, not greasy at all.",0
"Had dinner here the other night and it was lovely. The dragon phoenix soup was amazing, the service was wonderful, we'll definitely be going back.",0
"Very nice staff.  Nice variety of options.  Good food (I'd give it a \""B\"")",0
Older theatre but it still does the job! It's got a lot of character to it and sometimes you can see a pretty decent concert there!,0

Tuesdays is the busiest and best day to order pizza.\nBuy one get one free.\nShorter wait times they say.\nPizza is so cheesy,0

i don't know what to say their double chicken bowl deal is delicious! you get a lot of food here for your money i think plus the salsa bar is pretty dang good itself!!!.,0
This isn't my usual Capriotti's location but I was driving by and decided to stop.  I ordered my usual turkey sandwich with extra pickles.  The guys working here were very friendly.  I recommend this place to anyone.,0
"This pho place is quiet and small.  The broth is a little lighter than most but its inexpensive and still very tatsy.  The staff is friendly and helpful, have been and will be back for times to come!",0
Cleaner than any other QT I have ever been to. Very well stocked. Pleasant experience each time.,0
A pick up with many items missing.  Including tortillas for tortillas for fajitas.  Would of been excellent but couldn't drive all the way back for tortillas n sour cream defeats reason we had it pick up,0
"Absolutely love this place!  Their delivery is so quick and the food is delicious. Plus, who doesn't love cheap food that delivers?!",0
Average Chinese food. Seemed like small portions but it was actually more than enough.,0
Horrible sums this place up! Stale bread with stale toppings. I will not give them a second try.,0
"I ate and drank at the lounge here during a recent summer stay at the Buttes.   I My favorite is the chips - the ones with bacon, blue cheese, and chipotle sauce...YUMM!",0
"um, no. Group dinner here was terribly bland. Wine and food disappointed izquierda y deracha. This is the Olive Garden of Phoenix.",0

"This target took out a that photo Center now they just have the portraits studios  it was nice to make your own photos and copies but that service is long gone stores pretty big they, The produce always fresh along with the meet.",0
Nothing about the Italian sandwich is Italian. It was gross. I've never not finished an Italian sandwich until today. The Wisconsin Cheese soup tastes like Velveeta. My water was my favorite part of the meal.,0
"Copps is alright, but they are expensive.  They have a nice selection of produce, but their meat prices are high.",0
"Worse experience ever! I walked in for just a trim on the sides wanting to keep a manly side part cut and walked out with half my hair gone. The stylist said he was the owner, will not be coming back.",0

"i love monicals.\nalways good to have some \""hometown taste\"" when visiting.\ni was told it has changed a bit, but to me it was still as yummy as before.",0
"Bought the half-price groupon for this place.  Except their prices are nearly double a normal store price.  Not really a deal, and poor selection.",0
"I used to love this place but the quality has gone so downhill over the past few years. They've substituted unique dishes with cheap, low quality ingredients. It seems they stopped caring circa 2007.",0
Bug in my food. Need I say more....,0
Good service phad Thai so so at best Archis is way better,0
my wife and i have been to this place a few times and have not had a bad experience.service is good and they have military discount and thats what really will keep us going back!,0

Food is always great and the service is very attentive... We'll go back another day.,0
Not too impressed but again I'm not used to north Carolina BBQ.  Service was great best fried pickles I've ever had,0
"come on.... if you want Chinese, dont go to a chain owned by Americans.  THis is a waste of time and money.",0

I love Michael V! So happy to have this talented in charge of my hair!,0

Was Disaponinted with the amount of time it took me to get service at the bar!! Staff was friendly and the decar was nice.,0
Came here to have drinks after school. This was my 2nd time here. Both times the staff weren't very friendly or welcoming. Not very attentive either.,0
There food is average at best.The highlight is the Al Pastor which leaves much to desire.,0
WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! I would rather eat at McDonald's then eat there again! I've been there twice and both times it was the worst ever!!!! Never going back! I'll take my money else where!!,0
Pretty chill atmosphere. Service was good. Beer selection is good. Lots of fun games to play and have a good time. Other than one creepster that wouldn't leave our table alone it was a pretty awesome experience.,0
"Good place to watch a sports game.  Beer specials were good. Food is very overpriced though.  The wings are about the worst I've ever had... and I've had alot of wings growing up in Buffalo, NY.",0
Rules made by men. Check them before you book this church to get married or any other event. Their restrictions are far beyond respect and more on the ridiculous side. Stay away from this church.,0
"The service was friendly, helpful, and the food and drinks were perfect. Cathy was extremely helpful with menu navigation. I will definitely visit again soon:]",0
I was actually surprised with how good the service and Chinese chicken salad was at lunch. Far better than the CPKs back home in SoCal. Way to go Phx AZ!,0
I ordered a small 11 inch vegetarian special pizza for lunch planning to keep half of it for dinner.  The pizza was so good that I finished it. Would recommend this place and I will be coming back.,0

"Have been here several times now and they are consistently great. They really do put the other place I used to go to to shame!  So glad to have found a place you can trust, who do a good job with great prices too.",0
Really...as easy and painless as it gets. \nEasy drive to/from the strip and they let you pull right up to your jet.\nI'll take it!,0
"Stayed for their buffet and played some bowling. Their buffet is decent for the price and it being off the strip. Their bowling alley is a little dated, I prefer the Texas Station's bowling alley personally.",0
"nooo DD will have to improve much more! After my little doughnut tour in the west coast, a DD will never compare to a mighty or a vodoo",0
Nice atmosphere but not so nice hot chocolate. I can be a food/drink purist sometimes and I didn't like them using chocolate sauce for my drink. Eww.,0
"Looking for a non commercial place too get wings while visiting Vegas, a server at our hotel recommend this place. Wings were good, crispy, not that frozen packed your texture..sauce was good though I like a little more heat",0
get the spinach florentine bagel with jalopeno cream cheese! very yummy!,0
"A casual place to eat and drink in Tempe.  Lots of outdoor seating and is a great place to come with a group of peeps to eat, drink and be merry.",0
"I've eaten here a couple times, once for breakfast and once for dinner.  The food is good but overpriced for the amount you get.  The employees were nice and the service was fast.",0

"Hallelujah, I feel amazing!!  just wanted to thank my massage therapist for doing an awesome job!!!  I needed this today...",0
My daughter chose this restaurant for her birthday dinner. We were very pleased with the experience. The waiter was helpful and efficient. I find it overpriced so I would save this place for special occasions only. Or when someone else is paying.,0
"Great food, very impressive draught beer selection with lots of excellent local beers. Waitresses were outstanding. Our regular stop to and from Raleigh.",0
Fresh and tasty. No two dishes taste alike and they are always efficient getting orders together. I just wish they delivered!,0
Unfortunately My Cousin Vinny has closed- the sign on the front states it is going to be a church (not kidding). Remodeling going on.,0

Been coming here since I was 13! I love this church. Everyone is so friendly and the Children's services are great as well.,0

Annie's Pet Parlor has always impressed us.  They are kind and gentle.  We plan ahead so paying with cash has never been a problem.,0
A great quilt shop!  They serve hot apple cider during the winter months.  Very helpful employees and a vast selection of Civil War and Kansas Troubles fabrics.  Great shop for making a folk art quilt.,0

This place is dated. The bar improvements look nice if the temperature wasn't sweltering...the monitors are old too. I'd much rather go to the alley on Scottsdale and Thomas.,0

"It's a like a stampede when you enter this store! The least of the problem is the other shoppers, but the staff are gruff and unfriendly. Wasn't worth it for me.",0
"The staff here is great, but the layout is a bit odd. Ladies literally freeze their asses off in the winter just to pee! Small intimate venue, i do like that it has two different bars, and music genres.",0
Great little Mexican place. The interior is very nice and updated. They have the best tortillas around and the prices are very good. If you haven't been here you should definitely check it out.,0
"Food was good, service was not as I expected, and felt very crowded due to the small area.",0
This account will open again and I am so excited.  Its a link to old school Vegas and the new owners are great people that also have roots here in Vegas.  I cant wait to see how it turns out.,0
Good atmosphere...wasnt crazy about the food...nor was anyone in my party. The area on mill st. was fun.,0
Service was very friendly. But this location needs a deep cleaning. It is very dirty with dirty bathrooms. Cleanliness is not a priority for this location,0
Good for very modern furniture. Quality looks excellent. Found a complete lack of help from sales floor.,0
"The room was not clean.  The hotel manager was extremely rude and aggressive.  \n\nSimply put, don't stay here.  For the same money, you can do a lot better.",0
My family of 3 go at least once a week. Excellent price and always a service with a smile. Highly recommended,0

I ordered an arrangement for a celebration of life and they never delivered and didn't call to warn me. Didn't receive a call until the next day. Unprofessional and unreliable!,0
"Used to be great.  Took the good stuff off the menu.... No asiago and beer bread, fish and chips changed to cod vs. Salmon.  Oh well, just will quit going.",0
Both my wife and I got sick the next day after eating at Carrabba's.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive but the food was not prepared fresh or kept at safe temperatures. We will not be eating here again.,0

"CLOSED!!!!!!\n\nWent to drop off some clothes today to find out this location has closed! There's a place off I-17 and thunderbird called \""Super Dry Cleaners\"" if you need an alternative!",0
Racks full of costumes. The perfect place for Halloween accessories. They even had a sale rack. Which is good because most fully decked out costumes aren't cheap. Cool stuff for theme parties also.,0
"Service was best part of our meal experience. Pork tenderloin was over cooked, mixed veggies were flavorless, trout was dry and overcooked as was the salmon. Very disappointed as I know they can do better.",0
"Super friendly! Went here to buy paint and magnets for my classroom.  There were lots of color options and many different shapes and strengths of magnets.  Also, if you are in the market for some good people watching, this place delivers!",0

"No more salad bar, what a joke. It would be nice to see new owners for this place that cared for customer service. Hate to say it but must, typical Buckeye.",0
Once a year I look forward to my lunch at this wonderful little place. Thank you for such delicious and nutritious food.,0
Good food but awful service. Hostess was friendly and the monkey cakes were awesome. Bloody Mary's were really good but it took 30 minutes for our food and thats unreasonable for breakfast.,0
"Generic, flavorless food. Don't let the open kitchen fool you; this is Panda Express without the cafeteria style line. Disappointed and won't be returning.",0
Some prices you can't beat! All other prices... You can! Lol,0
"Been there three times in 2 years, always disappointed by the quality of both food and service.",0

"The serving is good, but the steak dinner is not that good, also the sauce for the fried squid is strange.......",0
Came back again but the noodles in the pho were overcooked this time\nThe thai tea also had a bad batch of boba\n\nHowever their gui cuon and the peanut sauce were pretty terrific,0
I go here all the time (about 4 times a month) and i have never had a bad meal or bad service.,0
This place is NOT GOOD. DO NOT EAT HERE! It's the worst place ever!,0
"Delicious. We ordered dinner take-out, the Tikka Masala and Aloo Ghobi, both of which were fantastic. Naan delicious as well. Priced the same as all the other Indian around. Will be going back.",0

"Good news - my sister got the flowers and she sent me a pic from her phone.  They're gorgeous!  And they arrived just in time, too!\n\nThanks, Cactus Flowers!! =)",0
Crowded...loud...few amenities..what's to like?,0
Steer clear from their fish tacos! They were absolutely horrible!  The side of rice and beans were tasteless! Chips and salsa were good and that was it!,0
The drink is good but the food is bad. Comparing with LA store. Vegas store is not good at all.,0
"One of the better pool halls around, full bar, lots of pool tables, medium sized outside patio with heating lamps in the winter, and Guinness on tap.",0
"The band, the bar, the atmosphere was the most fun we had in old town. Imagine country red neck band playing neil diamond covers. Too much fun!!",0
"Good Service, Great Food!  Very impressed with portion sizes. Was reasonably priced. Ahi Tuna was fabulous. Would definitely go back..",0
"Great location, by the lake... that's the only decent part.  There's no parking when it's busy, the staff is rude and the coffee isn't all that great.",0
First visit I saw the Doctor in 30 minutes.  The second visit was about an hour.  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  All questions I had were answered.,0
Drove from Surprise to get here.  We weren't disappointed!  Great Italian food - huge deli department.  Wonderful breads and pasteries.  Mouthwatering treats.  We'll be Back!!,0
I work in the industry; needed to get nose pad replacements for expensive wire frames I wear everyday; they charged me 24 dollars with tax;  I could get them for free at most optical shops;  enough said.,0
The staff is very nice and helpful. They offer half off the visit fee for first time patients. Our doctor was very nice and he didn't push us to get all of the suggestions they had given us.,0
The only reason we went here was to use a gift card.... Just as disgusting as i remember.,0
The lemon chicken is amazing the orange chicken is amazing the egg drop soup is amazing the wings are amazing..,0
Not amazing but looking for a dive differently a place to check out!,0
Absolutely love Barrett Jackson - gets better every year. Great cars & awesome food vendors.,0
Great food.  Killer desers.  Owner and staff are very nice.  Really good food. Nice interior.,0
Not a huge fan. It wasn't super flavorful and I felt it was a bit too greasy. I think there are def. better options. I also saw this microwave as previously mentioned..?!?,0
The worst place to rent a car from!! They have no cars. Must wait almost 2 hours for a car and they don't care! Stay away,0
"This placed closed a while ago!\nWhen they were open, they had great happy hour hurricanes and deep fried pickles!  Regular menu seemed overly pricey.  Oh well...gone now!",0
Hard to find its in a residential area in the north west good old fashioned las vegas steak house worth the trip from Henderson though.,0
At any time of the day or night I know I can get my favorite soft drink or sweet roll. nice and clean rest rooms.,0
This is a great storage facility - Clean and well maintained with reasonable prices.  Working with Nadia in the office is a joy.  She goes out of her way to be helpful,0
"Great neighborhood location, great laid back environment (outdoor seating only), extremely friendly staff, and a deliciously unique menu. We'll be coming here often!",0

Wow the Gulab  Jamun from here is AMAZING!!,0
Steve the Pitt boss is a twat. Let you loose then bad mouth you for being there. Wouldn't drop my allowance for those to live. Beware,0

Honest mechanic shop with great labor rates. I had the best experience.,0
Great happy hour food menu! Fills up quickly!,0
"Place is horrible period.....,,went for all you can eat sushi quality is poor and on top of that a ton of rice!",0
The orange chicken lunch rice bowl was very delicious and so were the egg rolls. I will defiantly be coming back.,0
Average at best. Three stars is probably too much. Food was lacking flavor and we were extremely disappointed. I will not be heartbroken if I don't go back.,0
I went to this office today with my children to get glassesfor them.the staff and the doctors were very friendly and helpful. i highly recomend this wonderful office.,0
Ok subs I'd rather have a hot sub fire house.,0
The employees are friendly and seem knowledgable but 2 hours to get a flat fixed is unacceptable. I will be taking my business elsewhere from now on.,0
Oreo donuts tasted pretty good. The baked goods did not give me an orgasm but is a little more fun than dunkin donuts,0
Love this place. Great ambiance and food. Wish I could go weekly.,0
The setting is gorgeous.  The beer is good.  And the jambalaya is nice and spicy.,0
Nicely remodeled local bar with great service. There is usually a large mix of patrons from the working class neighborhood. Strong drinks for a good price.,0
This is a pretty good Arby's the food is fresh and relatively fast. The best part about this location is the warm and inviting staff.,0
"Big theatre, stadium type seating.  Service is good.  Pretty \""run of the mill\"".",0
"The wait was almost as bad at the food, I felt so cheated after waiting to be seated just to eat this well below standard dim sum.",0
"Low quality food! and as far as drinks, I ordered Ecstasy martini and I couldn't even drink it. It tasted really weird and I had to send it back. One good point though was they took that out of my bill.",0
These guys who run this aren't honest but their employees are honest hard workers.,0
So good!! never disappoints. especially when they are freshly made love the free samples!!,0
Great place. Never have had an issue with mailing anything from here. Prices are cheaper than the competition. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who needs to mail anything.,0
Good fish fry place. I've also had there Monster Burger- delish.,0
I have been here many times for dinner and lunch...mainly when family/friends visit from out of town. The food is very good and the enviornment is great. Eating outdoors is awesome when its not too hot.,0
Don't waste your money this was the worst Chinese I've ever had.  Absolutely bland flavorless food I think they keep there costs down be removing all the ingredients from there dishes.,0
Ok so the atmosphere was good the service was good but the pollo fundido is probably the reason i will go back..That thing for 11 bucks...ya sign me up for 2.,0
"Beautiful, well maintained and a nice assortment of food in the food court. Tortilla was my favorite! :)",0
"Go here.  Get a cheap hot dog.  A bum will ask you for it.  Go ahead and keep it.  It's your hot dog, after all.\n\nMmmm.  Hot dog.",0
"Awesome spot to grab a dog for a buck. Nothing fancy, must standard ingredients and friendly service.",0
I had dinner there the other night.  What a pork chop!,0
"Nasty, tasteless nuggets of over-fried batter. Even Long John Silvers is better than this dump. Of course if you're a drunk college student you may enjoy this after a night at the bar.",0
Chips were good but crushed to little bits. Shrimp cocktail was terrible. Cilantro rice pretty good.,0
This pizza is a step up from dominos!!! Who ever is putting 4 stars up don't know what good pizza is!!!,0
"Kids area filthy, fries incredibly salty, tables dirty. Love this food chain, but go to another franchise location. Go to StoneCrest or another to get a much better experience.",0
Meal was pretty average but would not go on a Friday night again. Very questionable patrons lots of leather tattoos and women that were overweight with tight clothes can you say cheap hooker!,0
"Service was nice and friendly, but slow and there was only one other person in the restaurant. The sushi was average, nothing to write home about.",0
They put way to much tire dressing on the tires when you drive off it splatters all over the car..\nMade it at 20 after 5,0
Draft selections are good...service is lousy...food is sub par. Not in a hurry to return.,0
Bar is okay and the atmosphere is nice.  Food is below average and pricey. Our food was cold and when we commented on that the sever didn't seem to care.,0
Quick and easy mans haircut. Just the way I like it and Renee gets it right every time.,0
"Mediocre food, average atmosphere...it did not live up to the billing it had been given by a friend.",0
"Horrible drinks.\nTasted like tap water with a little syrup inside. Worker making the drinks gave no smile; however, cashier was friendly and helpful when they made one of our drinks wrong.",0
"Great staff and the machines are always hot, the food is good and the beer is cold, cannot wait to get back to Vegas to visit this place.",0
"Ok food, found a hair on my honey dew melon slice, disgusting. \n$4.50 for a glass of cranberry juice. Nothing spectacular. Rather try something else.",0
Dive bar filled with perverts and heroin addicts. Looks like an Intervention Convention. Bartenders are weathered and bitter. Food tastes bad and they charge way too much considering they are a dive bar and not a nightclub.,0
"Absolutely terrible service!  Quality of food is declining.\nServer was Not attentive. Had to have food returned twice, and no manager came by to check on the problem.  Place is Terrible!",0
Great service. Very friendly and helpful workers. They got my requests correct and very knowledgeable when I asked questions. My new location.,0
"The food & wine are good & happy hour is great, but, as nice as our waitress was, she brought our wine & appetizer, but our pizza never materialized.",0
Cart path is very bad with lots of ruts. Course has been in much better playing condition with previous ownership,0
Seafood Noodle soup had slices of pork. The cilantro garnish wasn't even chopped.,0
I'm sorry but this pizza is not worth $15....plain and simple. Go spend your money somewhere else.,0
They had really great pizza! It was also big enough for 2 to share,0
Great food...worth the drive.  Chicken and humus is very good and the lamb is some of the best I've had.,0
Completely charming. A true respite from the busy city!! I found something for the gardener that has everything.,0
The prices are obscene they cook in nasty old grease we had the fish and shrimp both were awful and not enough a two year old could prepare better food! We were Very disappointed and will not be going back.,0
Horrible food!! Crab legs had a funny smell and weren't fresh. Definitely not worth $15.99. If you know what great food tastes like do not waist your money here: (,0
"Liked the place..had the type of fabric i was looking for, just not the color.  must have patience to go through the fabrics since its some what orgazined.",0

"nice people, good food, one of my favorites to watch a game and play video poker",0
can spend a long time here looking around some days you find something good other days well not so much,0
The waiter did an excellent job explaining the different cuts of meat. The staff was well educated about the product they were selling. I would have loved to see a better variety for non steak lovers. I had the salmon and it was not seasoned.,0
bottomless cups of Indian Tea and the best vegetable Korma I've had anywhere. They make their own Paneer & let you buy it if you want to cook with it at home.  Fantastic!,0
"Great place great service Michelle is an amazing Waitress,  you will given great service for sure if you are fortunate enough to have her as your waitress!",0
Not a bad airport at all!\nSecurity line was much better than in the past.\nTaxi line moves quickly too!,0

Great job always keeping us happy...WAY BETTER than Pizza Hut...always improving...thank you for your service!,0
"Simple, not too far from town. Just watch out for slow moving people.",0
"Supplies are great - wide variety and well stocked at all times. \n\nCustomer service is a different story. No one ever looks particularly happy to be working there, nor are they helpful without prompting",0
My buddy found glass in his noodle bowl glass.  As hit bit down and starting spitting glass out of his mouth we decided that this was are last visit here.,0
The Staff is VERY rude the manager is even ruder kept talking over me then slammed the door.. stay away from this location.,0
Waiting room nice and cool... But they would not honor the yelp discount... \n\nCar should be nice and clean though :)\n\nUsed to come here all the time hopefully service is walgat it,0
Food is great and it comes out fast.  I usually end up at the waffle house at night so I can't comment on the day shift.  It's one of my favorite places to grab a quick bite late at night.,0
little older of a hampden hotel. Overall ok...Not great not bad.,0
"Great for to go/takeout, cute, small dine-in area, really good quality food...\nGreat Gyro and Kebob...\nWill repeat often",0

"OMG this was good, crab tostada were to die for. I would have never discovered this place it it weren't for yelp. Next time we are in the area we will be back!",0
"The stuffed burgers they sell, awesome. Frozen cheese curds are also available here, oh yes.",0
"\""When music was music, and lyrics were lyrics\""",0
If you're after mediocre that takes a really long time to get to your table you have chosen the right place. \n\nSave your money and just go to Wendy's which is right next door and servers a much better burger.,0
Favorite Pho ever!  I love this place!  The iced tea is amazing!  The service was great too!  I highly recommend it!,0
Great customer service! Manager came around greeting guest and asking if meal was good.,0
Always busy for HH! They have great patio seating (not in the sun). Food is fast and fabulous. A great place for out of towners to go see the Scottsdale scene and not be disappointed!,0
"I got the chicken and veg bowl. It was so bad that I threw most of it away. It's drenched in sugary sauce, and the chicken still has tendons and fat on it. Not great al all.",0
"The food is a joke.  I can understand if you like the atmosphere, but let's all get serious about the food.",0
This was a really good venue! The seats we had were very good and all the employees were very helpful and knew what they were doing.,0
Great old-school donut shop with delicious donuts.  The even still tie up the boxes.,0

"I am back! The foods still greats, the services awesome and now they have beer and wine..lol!",0

"I tried a wine tasting a loved everything about the place; atmosphere, service, and wine and food were excellent. \n\nHighly recommend it!",0
Way over the top with the christian music and christian icons. Coffee is ok and the staff are pleasant - just not my cup of tea,0

"Really. Good. Pizza.  Great variety of beer and wine.  If you are in downtown, and want a good meal, eat here.",0
Great beer and food specials.  They had the Michigan game on too!,0
Food was pretty good... you pay for the view though.  BBQ nachos were superb.,0
I would give zero stars if I could. After waiting in the drive-through for half an hour they told us they cannot take credit cards.,0
So much better than Pei Wei right next door. I am a big fan of this place for lunch.,0
The Pizza is above average for Pittsburgh but that is not saying much for Pittsburgh pizza.  It does not even compare to pizza from New York or Chicago but takes a close second to a DiGiorno pizza.,0
Much better than streets of New York and there wings are the best I go there all the time,0
"As far as campus bars go, this is as good as it gets. A great place to gather with a small group of friends and drink some beer.",0
The delivery is insanely fast!  And the food is delicious!  My daughter loves the chicken lo mein and I really like the General Tso's chicken and the crab puffs.,0
"Very clean, friendly staff, decent prices. I paid only $22 for a full set of acrylic and they looked great! They also have great spa chairs for pedis inclufing a hot rock massage.",0
"Awesome.  Just awesome.  The gyro meat is made the way it should be and shaved off when you order.  Its a messy, greasy bundle of deliciousness.  And the fries are good too.",0
They gave me an amazing price and excellent service!,0
Awesome bargains and prices! I have found a new shopping spot without having to feel guilty.,0
"After my second visit to Cathay House for Dim Sum, I'm giving them another star.  The food is excellent, the service is speedy and the prices are very reasonable.",0
No coffee ready at 5 am? Really. Nothing much else to say.,0

"Downstairs, a bit awkward but food was decent.",0
Stopped in to use a Groupon. Needed advice on plants for yard on side of mountain were rabbits eat everything. Got best advice I've ever gotten in the 20+ years I've been landscaping. Thanks!,0
"They offer great prices but unfortunately their service is ridiculously time consuming, they quoted me 45 min, it's been almost an hour and a half and they still haven't gotten to my car",0
"Tried to go, they were closed an hour early with employees outside drinking. Not impressed.",0
Pretty awesome place. Great pools and kid friendly.,0
"The worst gyro we ever had. Bad service. Very dirty place. Gross bathrooms. Use to be a good place before, not anymore. Stay away...",0

"Sorry, the famous ribs were short on meat and overcooked. The deli slaw was soaked in vinegar.",0
"Fairly terrible experience.  We are avid Mexican food fans but this place is horribly overpriced, mediocre food.  On the bright side, the chips and salsa were pretty good.  The service was also fairly good.",0
Great home style food.  One of my favorite breakfast places.,0
Amazing store -  found a great fresh pasta selection and all found a cheese with black truffles. We bought 4 kinds of pasta - all fantasticad fresh!!!,0

Great service and great food.  Love the combo plate.,0
"This review only relates to the Oyster Bar at Texas Station.\n\nTheir decision to do away with the \""lunch portions\"" will result in the elimintion of their lunch business.\n\nDumb!",0
"Out of my price range, but displayed glass items could use a cleaning and/or dusting",0
Good course.  I would guess your satisfaction will be tied to the price you pay.  It's a little nicer than Angel Park but it's greens could be in better condition.,0
"great philly cheesesteak, hot bbq wings, fries, pizza. Good place to drink that is not a bar.",0
"Very good food, pretty poor service.  Atmosphere is nice, but not amazing.  A solid choice in restaurant.",0
Picked up 2 dozen donuts for the office this morning.  Delicious; everyone is happy!\n\nTip:  They only accept Cash.,0
Fresh food and the service is great 90% of the time.  Only complaint is the frequent wait list.,0

Love the atmosphere here and the fire pits. The food is decent too.,0
Beer was cold. That is about all I got,0

"Nice location, interesting cocktail menu, but nothing is done particularly well. I still go there, but I wish the cocktails were made using fresher ingredients.",0
"I've been eating here twice a week for years, because it's one of the few places around where you can still get liver & onions.  And I really like the atmosphere and music.",0
"It's an ok casino.  However it is not on the strip, so it will be quieter. Generally will see more locals than tourists here.  Always have seen friendly staff, and food has been good.",0
Good Hawaiian/Korean style food and good island people.,0
Cute little coffee shop. Had some tea and sat outside with my boyfriend. Enjoyed the weather and played some cards. Very relaxing.,0
The food was great and the staff was super nice! They have really great coffee options and omelets with everything you can think of in them.,0
"Classic Tempe location should not be confused with quality food. Bad chips, chicken cheese crisp was mostly salt, guacamole tasteless, and did I mention too much salt. Service however was great!",0
"Food is sub-par/prices average. But hey, I'm from Ca.",0
It's a fast food Mexican spot... It is good not great. Better than Taco Bell that's for sure. The 5 dollar specials are great!,0
Don't bother going here to watch the NFL unless you're a Packers fan.  Refused to turn up volume in a room full of Bears fans so we could actually hear the game.,0
Ok hotel in a non-descript locale.  The hotel itself is very dated.  I would look for other hotels unless you are using point like I was.,0
Love getting my nails done here. They always have an opening and the place is so much cleaner then the other places I've tried.,0
"gross, smells filled with dirt and bugs, hookers hang out here, this is a gross hotel\ndo not stay here.",0

"I've eaten here several times and liked it every time. The staff is very attentive and friendly, I love the patio, and the food is pretty good.",0
"Saw a great show here, fun chill vibe, and seems like they always have bands coming through. Drink prices are great. Feels a world away from Mill, and this in a very, very good way. :)",0
"The food is awesome, the service is good. The prices are a little pricey but the portions are large. I would recommend.",0
The food was excellent.  Nice selection of food.  I truly enjoyed the atmosphere.   Additionally the staff were very polite and around frequently enough to provide great service.,0
Food is great. Chips a lil salty but a lot of food for great price. Server was very friendly,0
Why would anyone pay money for food like this?,0
"Pretty fun spot.  There is live music in the downstairs area, and a club in the upstairs area.  Good for groups with different tastes.",0

Very tasty food.  Extremely pleasant employees.  Great check-ins through the meal and the drinks didn't go dry.,0
This place is pretty good but be careful if you have tinted windows because they messed up my drivers side tint,0
Low inventory no service waste of our time went there based on posted reviews very disappointed ; (,0
"Have never eaten there, but went for cocktails after a show. The atmophere is very nice, slightly upscale, but not too upscale, and the drinks were reasonably priced. Would go again for sure!",0
"5 star service and a wonderful beet, wine, and spirits selection sets this market apart from the competition.",0
"Where to start? The food is bad and overpriced,, I love pizza and will gladly pay extra for great pie butt. Brixx is not the case!",0
"Food is ok, kind of bland. Chicken was chewy and cold. Nothing special about service either.",0

Beer was good but food was mediocre at best. I will not be going there ever again because I did not feel welcome. Not impressed with service.,0
The credit card system is down  and they don't tell you until you get up to order. So than you are stuck in line to pull through.,0
"It's a Macaroni Grill... not much to say about this... if you have gone to one, you have seen them all. Nothing is really memorable. Including the service. Prices are reasonable.",0
Only had a couple things at this attractive little restaurant - a soup and spring rolls - but I have definitely had better!  The service could be a little more relaxed.  I think I'll stick with Thai House.,0
"The atmosphere outside on the patio is nice, but the food wasn't more than mediocre at best. Good service.",0
Been here twice and both times had to wait forever for our food even though the place was dead. Food is good if you have the time to wait.,0
This place is a hidden gem.   From its baked goods to their filling sandwiches you cant go wrong.,0
Nothing special. the food I thought was too greasy and its definitely not an authentic place. Only went once and not going back,0
Good atmosphere. Decent food. This place needs a better rating.,0
kind of expensive and not the best... expected more from a place where the other restaurants are soo good...,0
Moved to Chicago 6 months ago. I am in desperate need to find pizza like Napoli's has! I can't find it! This place has great pizza and wings - I miss it. I think I am going to cry.....,0
Always an hour wait. My cats would get sick every time after coming home from here. They are strictly indoor cats. Also way over priced even on the half off days.,0
Way overpriced for average food and less than average atmosphere.,0
I have had Slade landscape do my maintenance for 2 years now and do An exceptional job and always are willing to take care on anything I need done.,0

Nice outlet mall. Lots of store to go shop. Nice and quiet. Not to mamy ppl. Security everywhere. Lots of food to chose from.,0
"If you don't like your food... do not send it back to the kitchen... The \""Chef\"" will come out and scream at you... Stay away from this place.",0
It's a nice store but too much for me.    All the people are really nice and helpful.,0
"Good food, fun atmosphere and friendly service...  The beer is not bad either.\nTry \""lifting the kilt!\""",0
No flavor in their food. The service was great but the food was disappointing.,0
Beware of any warranty. They will change the rules and not honor a lifetime warranty.\nVery poor business practice.,0
"Great customer service checking out today, it's alway nice to have a knowledgeable cashier.",0
I can't find a better deal for such great fish....,0
I had the beef hash for breakfast which initially was very tasty but developed a sort of sweet taste which was odd.  The potatos were very good and the fresh orange juice was great.,0

Cheap lunch buffet. But I don't like India food. Everything seems disgusting. And smelly.,0
"the buffet, you, must...go to it...nurrrrrr, AMAZING!",0
Really cool rainbow lights when you drive down the freeway at the evening time. Parking seem to be really difficult unless you want to pay the price for VIP designs are really fast.,0
My family has been using this dental office for over 10 years now!  The staff really cares about their patients. I love this place. Not a fan of getting dental work done but I surely wouldn't do it anywhere else,0
"Another day another Italian sub. Firehouse makes them very, very well and always tasty. Just the thing to hit the spot on a long shift.",0
Just a plain ol' pawn shop with overpriced items due to the success of the show...I've seen wayyy better pawn shops than this one... but had to check it out anyway...lol,0
Pretty good coffee. Nothing special but better than starbucks by far.,0
"Capital Grill is what is is. A steakhouse chain. It's predictable and classy atmosphere is great for business entertaining. With so many food options here in Phoenix, I certainly wouldn't take an out-of-towner here.",0
"Pretty good food,  the selection was great the service was a bit slow and I had to seat my family my self but overall it was ok, all day every day 99 cent margaritas.",0
"Although they are known for their adorable cookies, I am not a huge fan. Whenever I have ordered from them, the service has not been great and my pastries are usually dry and not that tasty.",0

Typicall bar food.  The golden wing sauce is really good.,0
Tech arrived right on time and was very thorough. Did a great job explaining the work that was done.,0

Did I just pee outside?  I think I just peed into a cascading waterfall deep in the wilderness. This place rocks.,0
The food was okay. Neither my friend nor I thought the food was very good. \nThe service was terribly slow. It took a long time after we finished our meal to get the check and even longer to pay for it.,0
The place is good for drinking but definitely not to have a meal. There're not much options on the menu. \nI tried the pasta once and it was tasteless.,0
"Great coffee and Tea selection.  Good prices for latte's, cappuccino, ect...",0
Dinner for 4. Everyone was happy for the most part. My salmon was a little salty. Hubs steak was delish! Everything looked great and our waitress was nice.,0
Ticket line fairly quick. Concession had lots of choices prices average for movie theaters. Great seats. Clean and comfortable.,0
Had my hair cut by Rachael!  She is an amazing hair desinger.  Wonderful experience everytime I go to this salon.   I will be back.,0
"Meh. \nGreat service, blah food, but it was cheap. That's the only thing this place has going for it. The bathroom was clean, so there's that.",0
Food is pretty good but the serve is horrible!,0
All you can eat BBQ! The steamed egg was the best dish. The marinated foods were really sweet.,0
"On vacation, found this place.  Great food, huge portions.   I'd return any time.",0
"The lunch buffet is $6.50, but it is awful.  Horrendous Chinese food. I will not be returning.",0
Great Food nice service great steak kind of hidden but well worth the drive +byou can buy restaurant.com to make it cheaper,0
"What kind of \""mall\"" closes at 5pm on a Saturday night?! This crappy mall, apparently.\n\nUgh. Poor selection of stores, rundown appearance, and ridiculous hours = FAIL.",0
This is sort of a cute wayside ice cream stand but the food is less than average and the ice cream is ok.  I haven't been there in over 10 years.  what does that say?,0
"Chicken was dry, veggies & egg rolls were soggy. Go to the one on 67th, it's way better!",0
Pretty decent coffee shop and its open until midnight on weekdays.\n\nThe coffee was good and the staff were nice. I will go back. Nothing spectacular.,0
"Still the best in Pittsburgh, hands down......More later",0
The man serving me was very rude. I tried to ask a question before ordering and he brushed me aside.  Then I got my order and it was not what I expected - egg in chicken salad!? I had to chuck the whole thing.,0
Love coming here. Plenty of room and machines. Everyone is real friendly.,0
"Nice people, busy busy busy place, but always great service, fast kitchen.\n\nThe kitchen is super fast for carryout.",0
The best birthday cake in town! The sandwiches are super delicious! Love this place!,0
Went through the drive thru  for just dessert and waited 15 minutes. Maybe longer.  the time i went through was at 12:17am in the morning. Usually the service here is pretty quick.,0
Nice enough store. But there was no sales people to be found when I needed help looking for a specific item in house wares. Prices were decent.,0
I got the baked apple pancake. It was large and filling but didn't seem especially well prepared. It was thick and heavy. I didn't finish it.\nI also got a side of bacon and that was average.,0
"Great food (blackened red fish was AMAZING), and excellent service. Fun for the whole family. Definitely going back!!!",0
"The service is terrible, It took at least an hour for my table to get our food after ordering it. Not to mention it is cold inside, and uncomfortable. The food was average.",0
"Great pancakes and free refills on soda, as soon as I finished the first drink the waitress came with another drink immediately. Friendly staff and fast service (5PM).\n\n- The toilets were not clean.",0
"This is where I get my Korean Hawaiian plate fix.  Love the veggies that come with the meal, so Ono and the soup.  Saimin is awesome too.",0
We ordered a mixed plate and saimin. Portions are pretty generous.  Will come back again.,0
Great Thai! Last visit I ordered the green curry and will again. It's a bit overly cozy for romantic date night but the perfect place for lunch with my daughter.,0
Went for lunch had the fish fry. Really bad over cooked just bad. Will not ever go back,0
Old packer is now chiefs tavern. Cleaned up remodeled.great food and beer! Very clean.,0
This place has NEVER gotten our order right.  Not once.  Lame.,0
It was fine.  Most anything tastes good in butter.,0
"A little pricey but it doesn't get more \""natural\"" than this. Great juice bar and cool stuff to buy if you're into super hardcore natural foods.",0
Best Indian in Madison. This is my happy place. The dining room is always filled with other happy Madisonians mowing on Indian. Maharaja - do it. And be sure to order the masala tea.,0
many amazing nights at the tumble inn.\nthe only place i could and can get a ice cold woodchuck.\n\ni miss the tumble inn....was good to be back in for a visit recently.,0
The service is horrible. Don't waste your time or money. You'll get better service at Jack in the box.,0
it's in a bad location in Chandler. Long wait and the quality is not good. Place is dirty and stinky. Go to a different location.,0
"Amazing breakfast burritos! Heat up so well the next day, go here at least once a week!",0
"Hmmmm, well the food was okay. the service was okay. the atmosphere was just okay. \n\nThat sums it up.",0
"The fitting rooms looked like they haven't been cleaned in a while dirty tortillas on the ground...Ok over all, good selection but not the cleanest Target I've been to. (This was the Ahwatukee Target store)",0
"Will not recommend this place to any of my family and friends living in Tolleson. The food was not good at all. Service was bad, she never came back to refill my coffee cup, which was the only thing I enjoyed.",0
"My daughter who once told me she loves whoever invented meat asks to go here, I think that pretty much says it all.",0
The place is nice and Big! lots of seating space with a few comfy seats such as lazyboy style seats. In a really cute house looking thing. The service is ok. A little more friendly would really make this place pop.,0
"Great room - terrific pool & hot tub. Very accommodating staff. Beautiful locale. Quiet & peaceful, yet close to Scottsdale.",0
This place is god awful...very Americanized german food.the staff is sloppy...if you want cheep German good that is what you'll get,0
The wait staff was totally rude. The food was nothing to rave about considering the prices.,0
Don't wash your car here. Car looked almost as dirty afterwards. Old and run down as well. I am bummed.,0
First time to Oregano's.  We'll be back.  Extensive menu.   We chose pizza and it was delish!   Music a little too loud but we'll definitely go back.,0
Had shrimp and grits for lunch.  Was not expecting much having lived on the Gulf Coast but was pleasantly surprised.,0
This place is okay. The waiter was horrible and barely checked on us. The food was also not too good. It was very bland and didn't have a lot of taste to it. I will not be coming back.,0
"Took forever to be seen even though I was the only one there. When they transitioned to FastMed, no patient info was transferred, had to fill out all the paperwork again. Scale said I was fat. That's it.",0
Had to come back again before the end of my trip.\n\nWas just as good as the first time. \n\nI will miss you sweet tomatoes and I still beg of you to come to NYC!,0
This is a filthy place.  Several times I saw cockroaches crawling around.  The service is terrible.  Only thing I like is their barbecue items.  Now I don't even go there because Mekong has better barbecue.,0
Great lunch spot near the office.  Decent beer selection and tasty food choices.,0
Guacamole needs help! Fish tacos were good. Taco salad was good too. They need to keep doors closed to keep flies out!!!,0
the chicken wings gave me food poisoning.  will avoid in the future.,0
"This location is closing as of Monday, January 31, 2011... :(",0
They raised the prices on the machines by a quarter.  There still aren't enough laundry carts to go around. There are like only 7 in the entire laundromat. When it's packed it's every man for himself.,0
"Food was very good. Fagiole had nice hint of thyme, and cannelloni was quite hearty. Decor only so-so. Staff friendly and helpful.",0
Nice sit-down Chinese place.  What else is there to say?,0
Nothing off the charts but not bad for a simple lunch or dinner or to meet up with some friends.,0
"I'd give this 10 stars if I could. Great vibe, fun times, and cool people!",0
All they did was try to up sell me.,0
Horrible wait. Horrible service. First and last time will ever patronize.,0
"Great service and great food.  The bread they used for the subs was so good.  If you eat here get the fresh cut fries, they're also amazing.  Nice lunch environment!",0
"the food itself is worth 4 stars, tasty toasted subs-parking is not the greatest but its worth the effort",0
Short but helpful staff. And great new building in a great new shopping center. Lots of self-checkout and fabulous hours (until 9 on fridays!),0
Been here a couple times and the food is great but the service has been eh..lets just say it could get better. But it wont stop me from coming here! lol,0
The bed was exceptionally comfortable. I also loved that there was a Starbucks right outside the hotel. The gardens looked amazing!,0
This place is awesome. What I think an old fashioned supper club would be like.  Huge bar and lots of seating.  The cheese curds are delicious and the fish fry is a must order! Good parking too.,0
Great night last night. Our server was wry prompt and Nice. The Food was really good.,0
"Service, excellent. Food just edible. Place feels a little dirty, sticky tables and seats. Won't come back. Been to far better Streets of New York restaurants.",0
"Nice hotel, somewhat fading with its decor and amenities like the pool and tennis court. Beware the fee and tax added at checkin that no one tells you about! Also great location in the heart of tempes downtown",0
Had early dinner.  DBacks playoff game underway which drew everyone's attention.  Service was very food and food was great.,0
Chicken chimichanga very good nice and moist chicken. Chicken fajitas very good and full after eating,0
Great service. Food was good bar food nice atmosphere. Great place to chill and have a beer.,0
Getting charged for ranch when it comes with your meal is ridiculous. Who orders chicken strip dry? Also the people there are rude.,0
Service is lacking and food is mediocre. When I crave Italian this is not the first place I think of.,0
"The menu is overwhelmingly long and their food is pretty tasty.  There are options for vegans, vegetarians, and any other dietary restriction you can think of. I wouldn't protest another visit.",0
Solid place...not fantastic or anything to write home about......But with the views of the fountain and a nice patio it's your best option for the location right on the park....but there are better places to eat in FH.,0
"Doors locked, no furniture inside.  Apparently out of business.",0
"Beware how much $$$ you give the bartender, likes to shortchange ya! Never that drunk that I don't know how much I am due back :(",0
WAY overpriced for what we got.  The room was musty and the food was so-so.  Very disappointed.,0
Average selection and service. I go because they carry liquid seaweed. Nothing special to report,0
This was the most disturbingly bland meal. Yuck.,0
Excellent southern Italian style dishes. Food is served family style so a small portion will feed two people. Avoid anything made with aioli as they do not do a good job with this.,0
Love this place. Love how they redesigned the whole entire inside! Super fast service and workers are always nice!,0
"Great food, good service. Nice wines. I love the tofu secuwa and the dal soup.",0
The pharmacy here is a joke... I have had several occasions of bad service here on top of one very rude pharmacist...Go across the street and save yourself the headache!,0
Great pizza fresh ingredients.   The pineapple is the best pineapple ever.  Home made salad dressings.  Never disappointed!,0
Came by for a quick dinner before going out. Service was pretty good and the food came out pretty fast. Portions are rather large for their moderate price range.,0
"Finally the nail salon i can come back!! Clean and spacious salon, painless procedure (whew!) and great selections of opi. Thank you, Christina.",0
"Love the sandwiches, wish that they would put mash potatoes and gravy on the Bobbie!!!!!",0
Chicago dog was awesome. Great selection of craft beers on draft too!,0
"Although the price of the food and service was great, the taste of the food was just okay. The menu was extensive but what I ordered was nothing special.",0
If you eat-in it is amazing here! Easily 4 or 5 stars. But when you order delivery the food and service get lousy! So spare yourself the heartache and disappointment and eat in!,0
Good food and Ice cool beer! what more can you ask for. the chilie is awsome,0
"Like what other reviewers said, this airport screams \""Welcome to Vegas!\""  yep... slot machines everywhere.   It's a busy airport but their straightforward and functional layout helps make the flow of people relatively smooth.",0
My son really enjoys the instructors at this dance center and it's in a very convenient location near our new home in Summerlin. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to get their kids into dance or tap.,0
"Food,service,atmosphere feels like back home! the prices are just outrageous...cheap! I'm definitely going to be back!",0
"I don't see what the fuss is all about. The food isn't worth going here for, and every other bar in town serves the same beer.",0
The atmosphere was pretty cool. It really is warehouse like. Could have been better with a bigger crowd. But the food was pretty bland.,0
Consistently the best airport in the country!,0
"I stayed here last night. I did not appreciate not having a coffee machine in the room, and the forced-on valet parking.",0
Update: the owner did write to me saying they will work on getting their takeout orders correct. I appreciate a business willing to improve.,0
"This is a crappy, dark theater that leaks water when it rains. Do not go!",0
"Super super busy airport, it's chaos all around! From walking through the terminals to trying to find seating in a restaurant or gate! It's just chaotic!! They  have a moderate selection of restaurants. Mostly quick grab and goes in terminal A",0
"Go, go, go!!!  Great food, fantastic atmosphere, cold beer,friendly crowd and staff.  If you are looking for a fun time in Scottsdale, you have to go here.",0
Ac didnt work cleaning staff walked in without knocking wont be staying here again,0
"You get what you pay for!   Cheap rooms, crowded pool equals nasty smoking people and nasty dirty pool water.  Shark tank is cool but the crowds are not.",0
"Been going here for 22 years.  The people are the same the food is the same, but the restaurant itself has improved over the years. It's cleaner and nicer although the decor is pretty much the same.",0
"I order take out every time,. Always polite and order is to my liking. I love some Pepper Steak and theirs remind me of the one from a favorite of mine from Chicago restaurant.  I definitely recommend this place for good Chinese.",0
"Have purchased trees here,tagged them,only to have them sold out from under me later.  Won't go there again, no matter how good the staff is. Miss the old owners. Kids don't count.",0
Yummmyyyyyyyyy truffles!,0
"This. Place. Sucks. The food is bad, the waitresses are nasty (and they suck at their job), it's full of a bunch of overweight degenerates in NASCAR shirts... Just bad all the way around.",0
1 star is generous.  They literary had 3 cigars for sale.,0
Party of One deal keeps getting more expensive.  Salad tastes like it was bought from Food Lion.\n\nPizza is what you'd expect.,0
"Loudest A/C unit ever!! Loudest people by the pool at midnight. And only 1 treadmill in the gym worked. Not impressed, but my room was clean(despite my do not disturb sign being left on the door).",0
Probably the worst airport in terms of signage in the US. The arrivals screen doesn't state the baggage claim area. Once you exit the airport there are no signs to find a taxi. Who designed this airport??,0
I love this place.  The vermicelli is amazing.  It is a cozy hole in the wall.  The food is so good.  And it's BYOB.,0
"Really good food but service was not at all good! We waited so long, our waiter was not a people person, didn't tell us about portion sizes, and the place was pretty dirty. (Can't imagine how the kitchen looks)",0
"Sopping at the shops at la cantera, golf nearby and six flags too there is so much to do in this area. Also drive to the local rim shops great sacks and Nordstrom outlet where bargains can be found.",0
Did camp zoo at phx zoo and the kids had a marvelous time. They got to meet the animals in their habitats and learn about the various animals in the park. One of the better camps in Phoenix.,0
"So good!!!  \n\nGreen chile pork appetizer, green chile Mac and cheese, fish tacos and short ribs were amazing!!!",0
This is a great place and the people are the friendliest. I really enjoy their food. It is always fresh. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. The management is the best!,0
"I like this place for business travel.  Within walking distance to lots of cute restaurants.  Good breakfast, comfy beds and quiet nights sleep.",0
Food was pretty good.  I had the Greek salad and my sister had pizza both good choices here.  Staff is friendly.,0
Jonathan in Tire Center is excellent.  Get there when they open 10am or expect to need a friend for a lift.,0
I really enjoy this place. It is always busy and the food and service are great. It's the small town resturant in the big city.,0
"Lots of beers to choose from. Food is just not good. Everything is overprocessed, frozen and dripping with grease.",0
"Good Southwestern food: Addictive chips, efficient service.",0
Pretty good for takeout. The meat is more sound than usual Chinese take out,0
"I have been using for business lunch/dinner.   Nice atmosphere, good servings.  Foods are ok, but they got nice wine selections.",0
"Avoid at all costs. I think their name is now XO Nails. They were unprofessional, dirty and in then end I am not happy. Should of left before they started.",0
Everything is good except that they need more cab lines. 19 may seem like a lot but apparently it's not enough.,0
Not impressed by this place at all. The bartenders were not friendly at all and the place looked like a dump. Not suprised since it was off Grand.,0
Reasonable atmosphere and prices at one of the few Thai places that serve wine and beer in the East End. The Green curry is good and the Pud is excellent.,0
Food was a 10 but service was abysmal from check in to wait staff just a disaster. Otherwise would have rated our visit tonight a 5.,0
"Horrible experience, bad service, sub-par food.",0
My husband and I both got sick after eating here.  How come there is always a line on the weekend?,0
The korean food is delicious overall but it takes FOREVER for the food to come out.,0
"I have been here twice, and while the food is good and the service is excellent, I have to agree with the first reviewer that for the money I could have been more impressed.",0
"Fabulous assortment of yarn, friendly help finding the right yarn for the right pattern.  This is a home away from home store.  Love to sit and knit and see what other projects are underway for ideas and inspiration.",0
Pretty good Dim Sum menu.  Best to go between 11am to 1pm for the best and freshest selection.  Prices are fair.,0
"Unfortunately, I didn't get to taste the food, as the overwhelming smell of sewage forced me to leave before I could order. We instead went next door to \""On the Grill\""",0
I took pictures while at this location last week. Its a ok store didn't care for the staff attitudes tho so I give it 2stars.,0
Tourist trap. Like a bad cafeteria on top of Mt. Washington.,0
Great experience would defiantly go back and recommend to friends and family the delivery was right on schedule and the\nDelivery persons were polite and respectful. Over all like I said a great experience,0
"Stop by the Hideaway today and had a good time. Plenty of bikes, food and live music. It's worth the afternoon to spend some time there.",0
This place is excellent price wise and has a decent variety. My only complaint is the setup of the seating...check it out...\n\nABRA...,0
"The farmer salad, the bread, and then the pizza. Who says you can't get great pizza outside of NY. Great meal. Worth a drive.",0
Too expensive for what it is....but then it's on the mt so they bump prices up for the tourists. The fries are incredibly salty almost inedible.  Good for tourists not locals,0
The girls at Splendid are the best and very professional. The experience was totally pain free in a warm and relaxing atmosphere. Would recommend them without hesitation.,0
"Cool set up! We liked the feel of the place. The food was good, but I guess we were hoping for really good. We would return but only if we were in the area.",0
Food was ok. Fries seemed like they were done already when we got them. Ostrich burgers were excellent though. Bar Tender at the time was somewhat condescending. Draft Beer was kinda warm. Sam the waitress was nice.,0
"We got the take out pad see ew tonight. It was not great. The typical pas see ew we've had has a sweet, brown, thick soy sauce. This was a very loose and spicy clear sauce.",0
Yummy food great prices!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wish the location was bigger so could go as a group. Limited seating but fast service.,0
Coffee was okay. Not all that fresh.  Service was also average. I think this place prides itself on being a vegan-friendly hemp coffee shop more than they pride themselves on serving good coffee.,0
As good as it gets!  Ask for Anna she does an incredible manicure and pedicure.  Very relaxing.,0
"Good food--simple, affordable and delicious!  Had the combo plate with brown rice and mac salad.  Good sized portions, and the service was friendly.  Kimchi and boiled peanuts were yummy!",0
Manager corrected issues noted in last review..very satisfied...will recommend this BK,0
Amazing fresh food and on the spot import deli meats and cheeses. Super amazing cheese steak. Best around. Friendly staff and all about quality!,0
-- Great little Hard Rock Cafe in Downtown!!\n****Service and food were pretty good.\n  They even had a small fashion show going on the night of the 26th. :) \nVery entertaining!!,0
Visiting from out of town we happen to walk upon this place. The food was good and the service was great. The menu itself has a lot for everyone. We did sample the beer it was good just a bit warm for my taste.,0
"What happened to this place? \n\nService was bad this time, wings were choking-ly dry! 2 months before yesterday the burger was gross but service was good. They used to have better food!",0
"very good food.  excellent service!  eggs benedict is the specialty here and it's excellent.  decent coffee and a great view of the tarmac, right outside the window.",0
"They have a very limited menu, horrible service, and a really pushy staff. I'm sure there are better places out there for cheaper.",0
Furniture Affair is awesome! They have a great variety of affordable furniture and accessories that you don't see everywhere else.,0
They charged up twice for the same order and then yelled at me on the phone saying that because I didn't have my recite on me it wasn't there problem and hung up on me,0
Horrible service and food. Not what Dave Thomas created or expected.,0
Typical retirement course. The greens were in good shape. Had some challenging holes which was nice. A good value for Phoenix in the middle of winter when golf prices are outragous.,0
"Favorite Dinner... Kolbi Ribs (well done) w/ Macaroni... Service is good, says Hi John every time I come in to eat.  Love",0
Somewhat perplexed by the recent negative reviews I have read.. I have been dining there for over ten years and have been pleased with the service and the food quality.,0
"Not only is the food delicious but the chief cook,bottle washer, and charming host Alex is a real treasure to his community. He supports the local neighborhood gardens and helps hold that little corner of the universe together. Vicki Chapman",0
The food is really good and the price is pretty good for all you can eat! However its kinda dirty and small so you would have to wait in a long line if it gets busy.,0
"Nastiest food I,ve ever had from a Jack in the Box, tacos were stale and extra greasy,  burgers were burnt, bread was stale and burnt, fries were old.",0
I used my android apparently and my food was ready before I was. The service was fast and friendly.,0
"I ordered bagel with strawberry, they put almond.... If you ordered bagel thing they give you regular bagel???? What happened?",0
Decent.  Room had a musky smoker smell to it. Nothing to write home about.,0
"Its basically the \""How I met Your Mother Bar\"" A place where you go to sit, talk, and have a beer. Good Irish Stout. Super-Hipster-Artsy. Friendly staff.",0
"Awful chinese food.  There are so many better places around south Charlotte than this sad excuse of a restaurant.  The food is tasteless, service is crappy, restaurant is dirty.  Please do yourself a favor and skip.",0
Ehhh. It just serves its niche clientele. if you are older and are accustomed to that style of food and service go and enjoy. Do not expect too much,0
"Meh. Mediocre, expensive food and rude staff. If I ever return, it'll be for beers only.",0
"Lose all your money at the tables if you must, but don't lose your dignity by eating here.",0
The restaurant looks dirty and greasy inside.  All the side dishes looked like they had been sitting there for days.  The flavor of the food was good tho.  But the restaurant needs a makeover and a good cleaning,0
"Love this store! Some of the cutest clothes, friendliest staff and best sales in town.  Only wish there was one in my home town of LA.",0
All Starbucks are not created equal. This location is good. Staff very friendly and helpful and the coffee was good!,0
"dinner was fantastic...all four of us were extremely happy with the food, service was get. Overall this place is a great local restaurant",0
This place is fantastic. they have a restaurant inside the grocery store. very good food.,0
The machines are worn out and old.  They really need to spend some money on new equipment. The free weight section Is fine though.,0
"Fajitas with burnt vegetables and a chx quesadilla with 8# of cheese, zero vegetables. I'll pass.",0
"I come here about once a week for lunch.  The pizza is always amazing, and they have a great lunch deal.  The reason for 4 stars? The staff is rude and impersonal.",0
"Short and sweet, and as a Haiku.\n\nParking is awful\nNo wine, but that's PA's fault\nBest organic food",0
"Great lunch place with delicious fresh sandwiches, soups and salads and an excellent wait staff.",0
The food here is okay...\nbut the service here is horrible.\nI would not recommend this place at all!!,0
"Don't drink the water... or eat the food. I got serious, serious food poisoning from this place.",0
"Too many TVs tuned to horse racing, bartender and servers all must've been having bad days. Can't comment on the food. Two stars for good beer selection, but lots of better choices nearby.",0
Did not enjoy my meal what so ever.The staff was cold and the seating area was dirty. The place was more of a hole in the wall then I can appreciate. Cheap but your getting what you pay for in quality.,0
Great dive bar option in old town. The drinks are pretty cheap and they always have specials. A lot of people start their nights here. One thing I dislike is the grimy bathrooms.,0
"Made the mistake of coming here on Black Friday. Store was packed and only two workers (that I saw). Wanted to get some Moose Munch, but left cause the line to get help was just too long.",0
Seriously!!!!! This place is the best EVER!!! You need to get down here and try this pizza and garlic knots!!! Best Service and BEST Food EVER!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!!!!!!,0

Visit THE DIAMOND for the Penguin goodies now.,0
"What a great restaurant! The food was great, the view was magnificent. What more can you say, they lived up to their reputation!!",0
Awful. These idiots have destroyed several of my shirts as well as several of my wife's dresses. They also iron wrinkles into my suits and shirts.  To top it off they overcharge and they're rude.,0
"Besides the seared foie gras & breathtaking view, the food was mediocre the last few visit.",0
This is a very fun airport. There are plenty of ways to kill time and money with all the shops and the slot machines everywhere. Also has plenty of spots to eat and drink at every terminal and close to almost all gates.,0
Love this bar! GREAT affordable food! Awesome gambling promotions! Free Slot Tournament on Sat night at 7! Bartenders are the best!,0
Huge portions! One regular order lasts me three meals.\n\nI'll be coming back here to fulfill my bbq cravings.,0
Love this place don't even have to get out of your car.,0
"Good product selection.  They didn't have the brand of hair that I use for braiding, hence 3 stars.",0
What's with long lines to get breakfast! Very disappointing.,0
My stuff was stolen from my room. Management and staff unhelpful and unapologetic. Going to file a police report.,0
Very nice flavors.  I like their menu and the sections of the different cuisines is interesting.,0
Great food! Best polish sausage in the world!,0
I would have ordered from this place again if the driver hadn't of scammed me for an extra dollar.  Look at your receipt!,0
The food wasn't very good and neither was the service. Also the Groupon gave us a limit of $17.95 per entree and the most expensive thing was only $9. We won't be going back.,0
I love being a part of this church. There is a wonderful music program. Amazing outreach to the community and an incredible children's program!,0

"Eh. Ok food, high school waitresses, blah bar. Wish I liked it more, but blah.",0
"Hard to find what you're looking for, even harder to find someone to ask.  Takes some searching but I always walk away with good stuff.  Overall I would go back for my crafting needs if I didn't have questions.",0
"I've been to Hawaii a couple of times to visit an old friend who moved there. Whenever I crave a plate lunch here on the mainland like they do on the island, I usually hit up Aloha Kitchen.",0
I got an almond milk tea and it was WAY too sweet. The prices are also pretty high.,0
Really old school.  Breakfast was good and the service was awesome!  My wife and I will be back.,0
The people here are very nice and friendly. After I paid I felt as if they were trying to rush me out the door.,0
"Like most food establishments in this part of Tempe, the price is right.  The sandwiches are pretty good too.  My one complaint is the lighting.  I'm not supposed to look green under any lighting.",0
"It was closer to 3 than 4, mainly because the shrimp fried rice was a bit too salty for my taste, but it was a generous portion like all the other yelpers mentioned. The people working there were pretty friendly too.",0
Some of the best coffee I've ever had -- and I lived in Portland. Insanely good selection & product. Tanzanian peaberry off the charts. Owner gets beans from multiple sources to ensure that his selection is the best.,0
"So dinner was filet & lobster, asparagus, mushrooms, wedge salad and sweet potato with fresh brewed coffee.  Outback has remarkable servers, delicious food and unbelievable customer service.  No worries mate - best steak in south Charlotte",0
"lots of subs to pick from, friendly staff, place is packed during lunch from all the government office around it",0
Enjoyed this beautiful zoo while on vacation! Perfect weather in December. Best part is the interactive activities they have for the kids. My favorite experience was riding the camel. Staff are very polite and make the experience much more enjoyable.,0
"The food was great, but the service was absolutely terrible. I think it took nearly 90 minutes for dinner for 2 people. It's a great choice when Lotus of Siam has a long wait, but be prepared for spotty service.",0
Place was packed on a Tuesday night so I had high expectations Was not let down The Hawaiian ribeye was cooked to medium rare perfection and I'm a stickler for cooking beef to order. Enough said really,0
"I was married here in 2006 and am currently going through a separation. So, would not recommend.",0
I love the products they sell.  I am consistently less impressed with the staff.  There is usually only one person per section who has a clue.  I try to find that person when I have questions.,0
"The food is mediocre, and the room is difficult to carry on a conversation in.  The building is neat.",0
"My best friend loves this restaurant and at her urging, we made a reservation.  The food was good, the \""show\"" was fun and the drinks were tasty.  \n\nUltimately though, it's just not my thing.",0
Cheap place and they let you take your food in so you dont spend a ton of money.,0
The decor is nice and makes for a nice ambiance. Good beer selection and pizza. Pool tables are some of the best in town. Overall great local place to go.,0
"I can only speak of the bar scene, and not of the food.  It was a good time!  Wish they had been playing better music, however.",0
I had there apple pancake all I tasted was eggs it was disgusting. I will never come back here,0
"A single star? You bet and that's only because these folks have something at at least resembles bagels, and they're overpriced at that. Go to the Bagel Cafe, which has real ones.",0
So far taking four times to fix patio door that they just put new rollers on an had to cut a little off the top. Would not recommend these people unless you want to keep calling them back.,0
"First time here and found it on YELP and it paid off.  From service, attitude, environment, food and beverage everything was excellent. Awesome experience all the way!!",0
Went to the Avondale location and we had pollo fundido and the spinich enchilada.  Food and drinks were really good and service was great!,0
I went there because craving for wonton mee. they do serve pretty good wonton mee. I've also order egg custard but disappointed because we know it's frozen food.,0
"Best experience at a car wash in a very long time treated the kids fantastic treated my car like it was their own.  Nice job team, MJB",0
The service was excellent. The beer was cold. The servers were damn near naked. I really enjoyed myself here. Two or three beers turned into an all night event.,0
"Great location in Verona!  The bar is beautiful and they pour a large glass of wine for a good price.  Food is marginal at best, but not consistent.  The only thing I enjoy eating is the cheese bread.",0
"Best burgers in C-U, hands down. \n\nHard to find the place, but worth finding.",0
"I wouldn't trust them to change my bicycle tire.  Very manipulative in trying to claim alignment is bad, need new air filter even though it was just changed a week ago.  Never coming here again!",0
"They accepted my online coupons not from Ulta website, excellent news.",0
"Food is pretty good, but a little pricey though. The atmosphere is nice. Waitresses are friendly. Been there second time so far. I would go back there again.",0
"Ok pizza, rude staff.  Not a fan and won't return!",0
"Rip off!  Stop raising our rates you douche bags. Get your crap together, cut some of your worthless emoployees and bring our rates back down.",0
It is the busiest holiday week of the year and they have one man working and two broken kiosks. 1 hour wait. I would do half a star if possible.,0
Truly enjoyed thier food here.  Went with another family and got Parrillada De Tres Carnes.  I highly recommend- its now my favorite Mexican Restaurant in AZ.,0
There was a lot of food for $6.   Love the Hatch chiles. So good and I am stuffed!!!,0
"Great neighborhood sports bar!! Price is right, lots of drink specials. If you like playing pool or darts this place is for you.",0
"Great food at reasonable prices, if you like PF Changes you'll love Pei Wei. Same company and very similar food.",0
Easy to navigate. Plenty of food options. Careful about the distance between terminals though..,0
"Friendly staff, excellent spicy chicken, used an entertainment coupon for bogo free meal.  Restaurant could use a deep cleaning as its quite aged. But love their spicy chicken tenders with extra Louisiana hot sauce.",0
"Place looks closed, but really is open. Fast and friendly service. Very knowledgable. I recommend going there and yelping your experience.",0
I come here when I want some pho. Think its somewhat better than other pho places. The pho taste a little less oily.,0
"interesting menu choices and just good food, but didn't impress me too much for the price.",0
"Whoa. Those were some damn good waffles. \n\nI recommend spooning half of the butter off your grits, cause once it melts there's not room in the bowl for the both of them!",0
"Main course was great app was bad... The manager was not very interested in my opinion on app. Her comment was \""well that's how we make them here. \""",0
"Best pizza in the 'Burg! They definitely don't skimp on the cheese and the sauce is awesome....it has a fresh tomato taste to it that goes well with the crisp, nutty crust.",0
"LOVE LOVE LOVE everything I've ever eaten here!  My fav is the Albondigas, but everything else is GREATNESS too!",0
"This place pissed off just because of the piss poor WiFi.  My phone has a better connection.Can't even stream iTunes.  Otherwise, not a bad place to stay in the middle of no where Az.",0
The food was warm not hot. The service was fast and friendly. The place was very clean. They need to put some woods in their fire and it will be better.,0
"Sometimes u get lucky and find some good deals, always have cheap snacks (candies, chips, cookies etc) today they had lots of Christmas decorations at good prices.",0
this pizza tastes just like peter piper pizza.. except the games and such.. awesome crunchy wings prices are great.. they have live shows on special days.. really great staff.. the wibe is great. great atmosphere,0
"Dr. Sanders and her whole staff are prompt & go above and beyond.  It's not usual that a trip to the eye doctor is actually an enjoyable experience, but here it is.  Definitely recommend.",0
McAllister's is always a great standby when you need a break from cooking. I've always been pleased with the food and the service.  Always clean if you decide to dine in.,0
"I just wanted to add an update for sound quality for the bands... sometimes it's really bad and sometimes it can't be beat....  \n\nAgain, the friendliness and service are always right on- great atmosphere.",0
Really rad place to have get togethers with friends. Would suggest calling ahead of time for a table. Small establishment. Decently priced food. Very friendly staff,0
"great, patient centered dental care!  Straightforward and practical, comfortable and professional with no over the top 'office features'.  I really appreciate their patience, flexibility and willingness to provide great care.",0
The staff is very attentive and the atmosphere is welcoming. We also enjoy bringing out of town guest here because the menu has something for everyone.,0
Hotel and Casino Are Dumpy! Old tvs from the 90's and the toilet was wore out uncleenable i think. Service sucked. Ended up getting rm service to get wings!,0
Service at the bar is top notch.  Beer was excellent.  Food was pretty good.  Packed on a Tuesday.  Worth the visit.  Take home a 6 pack!,0
It's nice that they serve alcohol here but the food seems really bland. I had the fried rice and orange chicken and really was not impressed. Sorry guys.,0
Always great service. Food very good. European portions. Pricey bit well worth it.,0
My sister and I went for full sets and pedicures. Pedicures were great. The 2 gentleman were kind and friendly. A little disappointed with the acrylic sets. Will be back for pedis.,0
"Service at the bar was great, the wine was great, but the food wasn't that great! Your typical franchise Italian restaurant!!",0
"if you are looking for fresh veggies, look elsewhere, their selection is tiny and what they do have is in bad shape.  if you're looking for ingredients to make vietnamese or chinese dinners, then you're in luck",0
Go somewhere else. Long wait at the drive thru. After they take your order. They make you pull up and make you wait for a long time for your order.  Like I said. Go somewhere else.,0
"Nice people, good stuff to eat and drink and decent wifi when I am hiding.",0
"excellent food, and great service and even better prices. I will definitely be coming back.",0
Amazing stuff! I do wish that the staff was a bit friendlier though if not I would've given it 5 stars,0
Beautiful and classy place! I've been a client of Steven's for a few years and followed him to this salon. He is a great stylist with a caring and friendly attitude. Highly recommend!,0
Not impressed. The service was below average. Food ok. Atmosphere very nice.,0
"Satisfied my husband's cigar craving on a Friday night. Will say if you blink, you'll miss it! Not actually in the plaza, but a stand-alone building next to Main St.",0
"First time here in a very long time, service was good, food was just OK. Probably won't be back, too many other eateries in Mesa to try.",0
"You can order your photo prints online and pick it up at the store. It is very fast, and thus the A-OK.",0
This place is adorable!  You can order coffees to go and take out orders or you can eat there.,0
"The service was good, but the food was terrible. I prefer healthy green vegan food rather than soy protein product and meat substitutes. The atmosphere is WEIRD! I'll never go back here.",0
"The boubo tea....is soso,but the food is ok... i dont want go back again..",0
Ew to poor service and less than desireable food!  No bueno,0
The food was awful.  The salad bar had wilted lettuce. The steak had absolutely no taste. There is a Texas Roadhouse around the corner. Go there!,0
Decent airport easy to navigate through. Slot machines are readily available giving you that Vegas vibe!,0
New shrimp cocktail was awesome!   Love them!,0
Most fantastic dogs around. Always a long line though so plan to take your time. Totally worth the wait.,0
"Pretty Ok food. I ordered Kung Pao chicken, it really didnt have that much chicken but it had a great flavor. Also order Egg fried rice and that was good too.",0
"Mediocre sandwiches and milk shakes. Also, the woman behind the counter was very rude and had a terrible attitude.",0
"Art, the store manager, is completely incompetent.  The rest of the staff is pretty much clueless.  They lack a basic understanding of pool chemistry as well as customer service skills.",0
"This is surprising gem of a restaurant. The food is very tasty, service was great. \n\nI'd go back for a special evening.",0
It's is the place for sushi in Tempe and south Phoenix. It's priced fair and the fish is so fresh. This is the only place I suggest for sushi in this corner of phoenix.,0
"Ribs were good, but sauce was a little too sweet.  Review was so close to 4 stars but the corn was cooked in margarine. Really?  Margarine?  C'mon you're in Wisconsin.",0
If you have time to look you should be able to find something you like here at a great price.,0
"We are very exited for the expansion of the store.  The service is excellent.  It has that small town homey feel, yet can meet all of your hardware needs.",0
"Starbucks is 'ok', I'm not really a fan of their coffee, I like the fact that they have restrooms and I love the cheese Danish.",0
Long walks to go anywhere. Mot great service. Key to room failed. Waited 30+ minutes to get assistance. Hotel was unaware of important events going on at hotel. The list goes on :(,0
"The host was an old italian man who was very very rude. The bread was stale, calamari overlooked place was terrible",0
"We ended up here because of the reviews we saw on yelp, and we weren't disappointed.  Great appetizers and great food!!!",0
"Gritty greens,everytime!...Need I say more?? Not what they use to be.",0
"Very good soup for starters, place is packed so I can expect everything else to be good to.",0
"Was expecting more fusion dishes, ended up being just another Korean restaurant. Food is pretty good for Korean, but we came here specifically for the interesting element of Hawaiian + Korean. And we saw none of that on the menu.",0
We went in for some breakfast after a late night. Waited for ten minutes for anyone to talk to us. Walked around the corner to find the waitress asleep. Take a nap before you come to work!,0
"REALLY GREAT!!!! Everything was awesome. The only issue I have is that there is a long wait to get food, but that should tell you something.",0
"Prompt service, great pho. I eat pho all the phoking time and this was amazing! the cream cheese wontons and the egg rolls were fairly decent, standard fried stuff.",0
Fast - Affordable - Good Food.  East of Chandler at the 101 - Behind the Kinkos.,0
We tried the prime rib tonight. Very Yummy.,0
"\""Food and ambience was great, but staff completely misinformed us about the price of the buffet; it was Way pricier than i thought...bad service\""",0
Decent food but the service is very hit and miss.  Usually miss. So disappointing considering the hype.,0
"Good, not great food, friendly staff, overpriced. Had the burger with brisket, and Mac and cheese, and a beer. Everything was competent, just not worth the $22. tab.",0
"Food is decent. Nothing special, but certainly edible. We liked the cheese curds. Service was good. Server was definitely friendly even though they were busy. Be prepared, though.....it's loud!",0
"food not hot, no flavor. people were nice.",0
"Great food, good prices.  We love to come as a family. Pizza and hot sammies are the best.",0
"Very small selection of rolls, very I competent staff. I wanted a roll with salmon inside and outside and they offered me Philadelphia. But rolls were ok, seems like a typical Chinese all you can eat sushi place.",0
some good beers on tap and a couple tables for stick---good buffalo chicken sandwich.,0
I went to this store 3 times trying to purchase a necklace for my wife's birthday. Owner won't sell. Maybe because I'm not white... she won't even hear out my offer. Will not be back.,0
"I always ALWAYS get terrible customer service at this location. If the tellers are not extremely awkward, they are being rude. I hate having to come here, unfortunately it is the closet one to my house.",0
"OK, the remodel of the gaming floor area is nice, but to close the shrimp bar was a complete slap in the face of history.  Dupars is too busy and expensive to make people feel comfortable just going for a shrimp cocktail.",0
Friendly service. Great food. Best part was I got my food right after I got done paying. Fast Service!!!,0
"I think this is the worst Pei Wei I've been to.  The food was very bland and the whole restaurant was, for a lack of a better word... FILTHY.",0
"I love Dr. Porter and his staff. They make you feel like family. Very thorough and explains everything to you. They truly care about you, it's not just a job.",0
"They are changing the layout around. OK, keep things fresh, but they took out the center spaces where one could cut through, leaving long long aisles. No bueno.",0
best chinese food in the world!! \nthats it!,0
"The service wasn't perfect, but the food was very close. The best part of the experience were the cute girls with large posteriors.",0
"Poor service mediocre food. NY NJ native we appreciate Chicago food, this was very poor imitation of Italian food.",0
I like this place.  They have fat free frozen yogurt in pistachio which is amazing.,0
"nice airport, very clean, lots to offer the traveler",0
"Average quality, barely, and lacking in taste and originality. The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily. \n\nThere were a lot of families here... they must have cheap kids menu or something.",0
A thousand times better at night when it's brightly lit.  Afternoons are gross.,0
First thing I noticed was the dingy smell when walking into side door of hotel. The whole room is out dated. Not worth the money. I'm surprised this place is in business with all the nice new choices in Chandler.,0
"Its a vegas casino, there is really nothing special, it has a movie theater, some average casino food and an average vegas hotel.",0
Maintaince and maid service should be better.,0
Food is good and cheap. I usually get delivery and it takes about an hour. Best chinese delivery place I have found.,0
Went in for a perm and the people were very rude. It is in a hidden out of the way location. Maybe the chain headquarters put it there on purpose. Hide the worst people in an area where no one will visit!,0
Good happy hour and attentive bar staff. The decor is very dated and the old cigarette smell sticks after you leave but it has a certain old school vibe about it that makes it unique. I enjoy their mussels and crab cakes.,0
Wasnt that great of a place and I was really hoping it would be. The food was rather bland in flavor and was quiet frankly over priced for what it was. Haven't gone back since my first visit to give it another chance yet,0
Worth checking out.  The food was good and the scene is relaxed.,0
One of my favorite lunch spots near my office. The food is always fresh and delicious. I love the chicken and ground beef kabobs!,0
"Friendly staff. Jesus and Jose were great and honest!! They inspected my brakes for free. No up selling, just fixed what was wrong and for a great price!! In & out too ;)",0
Very Beautiful restaurant - that's about it.\nI didn't expect fine dining but this was tasted like overpriced tv dinners.  It used to be ok now it just falls way short of acceptable.,0
aw more memories!  many a very early morning / late night meal at ritters... \n\nfood was always yummy...,0
I got a steak and potato burrito and they put freaking cheap French fries on my burrito to fill space. Del taco sucks big ones. The best part was the sauce that killed the flavor.,0
Great place.   Too many choices of omlettes to chose from.  People r friendly and it's affordable.   Food is great too.  And they have a balloon lady for the kids.,0
"Ick, Sorry, I did give you 2 stars for politeness.  Food was awful!!",0
"Super friendly staff, amazing milk shakes, and one of the best burgers I've ever tasted in my life. \n\nOh and it's cheap, too.",0
Its just keeps getting worse. Now its not even a hand wash anymore and it seems like they are more concerned with speed than quality or customer service.,0
Great restaurant! It really is nice to look at and the food is great. My friends and I have stopped in just to chat and soak up up the atmosphere over some chips and shirley temples!,0
I got the slow roasted jerk chicken (yes I know at the fish market!) and it was very very good.  For dessert I split the 'doughnut' with ice cream which was very tasty.,0
I have always enjoyed any location I have eaten at.\nThey offef what other fast food do not offer.,0
Be sure to get their Indian Curry. You won't be disappointed.,0
"Love the accommodating menu and atmosphere.. I can't wait to go back, I'm already craving their chicken basil.. umm umm good!!",0
"Good service, but pricey, just payed $25.00 for 5 golf shirts...just seems a  bit on the high side",0
If you like fancy rubber this place is awesome! I even got some soy ice cream (which normally I am a huge fan of) and it tastes like mud pies after a rainy day near a sewer.,0
"We ordered the buffet, the food was not very good and almost cold. The waiter we had did not say a word to us after taking our drink order, overall I'd say to avoid the buffet it, it was a waste of money.",0
local businesses like this are the scourge of Tempe. No concept of anything resembling service. Dirty. Inedible cardboard food. On it's way out.,0
I eat here at least once a week. The food is great and I also love how they've expanded their menu as of late to include dishes. I am a huge fan of their blackened salmon.,0
"Be careful when ordering! Apparently, they put roe (fish eggs) on everything but don't specific whether it comes on it. I ordered sashimi and it came out with roe.",0
"Before evening get to review the food:\n\nOne cashier, 10 people in line. You get the picture.",0
Food was average at best when you consider the price.  Our table had a broken leg being held up by a plate and portions of food were extremely small,0
The course was in horrible shape and the employees were rude and unresponsive. The practice facility is relatively nice though.,0
"Servers are chatting, not paying attention to tables. I can see my salad is ready at the window. Worst serves ever.",0
AWESOME Bruschetta and great wines!,0
Decent spot for pizza and beer. Hometown feel.,0
Great staff and phenomenal dentists. They really care about their patients!!!,0
"LOVE THIS PLACE! It's really fun and laid back, and is excellent for live music. If you can catch the Think Horses or the Sugar Thieves playing, all the better!",0
Always consistent probably the best deal in downtown. Food always good and price wise you can't go wrong.,0
"I stayed here fore a conference and what a great hotel and golf course. Was surprised they only have one restaurant.  Great facilities, gym, ground and course.",0
I've taken three automobiles to UAG for tint jobs and Brian and Helen always take good care of me. Great family business with great customer service. They will definitely continue to get all of my future business!,0
"The food is not good, and the service is really bad. They added the tips to the bill by themselves, which is very rude.",0
We went here on Father's Day and had a very enjoyable meal.  Overall the food was good and arrived quickly.  The service was great.  We'll be going back.,0
a lot of tacky decor\na lot of average wait help\na lot of messiness in the bathroom\na lot a lot of very average food\nand...\na lot of old people,0
had the chicken schwarma. it was too dry.,0
The quality has deteriorated immensely over the years. I used to love this place but the service and food have gone downhill.,0
Service is decent but food is highly overpriced for what it is. Will not eat here again.,0
Great place and great atmosphere now with the new renovations. Incredible beer selection as well and very friendly staff.,0
"Great, sleepy little Staples. Very friendly staff and a curious amount of items on sale and bare shelf.  I hope this location doesn't close.",0
"Food was alright, nothing special, a bit bland. The water tasted so bad though, bad enough that you could still taste it through iced tea or tap water, do they not have a filter!?",0
Oreganos is very unique Italian eatery. I have never ordered anything here that I did not really enjoy. They're Bellinis are the best I have ever had! But my absolute favorite thing to order here are there meatballs!,0
I've been here twice and both times did the prix fixe pasta tasting. The selections change frequently but it was always delicious and extremely satisfying.,0
"The lunch buffet is really great, everything is fresh and full of interesting flavor - nothing is spicy hot, though. Friendly staff.",0
"Buildings are modern and well kempt. Beautiful xeriscapes. Dining commons does the job.\n\nOh, and a great Radiochemistry department. :)",0
"I have been here many times for spring break with my family. It's a great hotel, very cozy, offers breakfast every morning which is great.",0
Food is good but dishes are a little high in price.,0
I can find some good items here every now and then....some of the employees I could do without.,0
I had the best time. great food great service.. steaks Mmmmmmmmmm,0
Always a nice visit. We stopped off at this Walmart at least every other day to pick up some food and wine. We found one of our favorite Australian wines Foxhorn for $6.47 a bottle.,0
Great food. Bar environment. You get what you pay for. Slow service when crowded but its worth the wait,0
"Poor service, awful attitudes and sub-par food.  I could make the same food in my own kitchen... Hope to see another Thai spot open downtown.",0
Ambiance was nice. Steak (pecan sirloin) was tasty. Waitresses were friendly. However was not overly impressed with restaurant. It was indistinguishable from other steakhouses.,0
Service was slow and inattentive. Potions were small. Prices are outrageous.\n\nPass.,0
"Amazing service from Jelly for lunch today, and seriously good food!  A wonderful hot sauce with heat and a great pico start things before you even get to sample the tasty tacos and enchiladas.  Highly recommended.",0
"Be careful. The servers can't pay attention to save their lives, and the management cares even less. I want to make sure people know how careless the management is, particularly Mark who seems to let his staff run around.",0
one of the best grocery stores. they literally have everything its amazing.,0
This place makes the Best Boba Tea in town. This is the only place my Japanese wife buys Boba Tea from.,0
"It's a nice hotel for what it is. Cheap!\n\nRoom was decent, had a clean shower and refrigerator. \n\nBed was soft. What else could you ask for?!",0
I can make BBQ at home in my slow cooker. If you want good BBQ go to Smokey Jon's not a chain restaurant.,0
This place is GREAT! So thorough. They're definitely good at what they do. They double check everything. I trust them with my '10 challenger and my fiance's '14 charger. I recommend this place to everyone I know.,0
Nice to find a dead fly on the bed after checking in! Nicely done.,0
This is your store for all your home paint needs. This is the best paint you can buy for your house. Don't waste your time at the big box stores buying low quality paint.,0
Had an awesome breakfast burrito this morning. A lot for your money. Better than the Filibertos across the street & cheaper. Love their Cali burrito!,0
"over price!  Ca Kho To never taste the same,  sometimes salty, sometimes no flavor at all! never go there again.",0
"Used to like this theater but recently I've found the excessive talking, cell phone answering and other shenanigans that are allowed to go on during movies to be unbearable.  Go to the mills or waterfront instead.",0
I was there last year with my parents and extended family. Service was terrible - slow and rude. I would not go there again.,0
"The food is so good here. A must try is the roasted duck, salt and pepper lobster and combination fried noodles. Very high quality here. I wish there was a Joyful House in Orange County. The service is pretty good.",0
They have a nice beer selection in the bar and cute waitresses.,0
"Pretty much my favorite chain Mexican food. Although you have a lot of choice for great Mexican food in the area, it's a pretty good place and has a lot of menu choices",0
"I finally found a good vet, yay! Needed meds and a surgery on my dog and they were able to do a payment plan. Thank you for the help!",0
"The restrooms looked like after an bombardment, an improvised shack amid buckets of olives and spices. Highly questionable hygiene for a food store!Disgusting. I will not go back until they clean up the place. It's just filthy!!!",0
"Burgers were great, you get free refils on fries.   Waiter was very friendly.   Only negative I could say is I ordered \""some pink\"" on my burger and it came out medium to medium well.",0
"Service is fast and friendly. We really liked our server, who checked in with us frequently. \nThe food was good, and hot. The only thing that could be improved is that the salad had visible wilt.",0
"Small, overcrowded, unfriendly staff.\n\nThe food is okay - typical Italian fair that could be better seasoned. \n\nThere are much better options nearby, but in a pinch, it's decent.",0
"Have been to many places but this is the best so far,it's great.",0
Simple menu. Cash only. Chili was particularly tasty. The Swiss burgers were quite good.,0
"Decent food at a relatively inexpensive price.  They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait.  The cheesy bread is really good.  I wasn't impressed with the salad.  The pizzas are enormous!",0
Great food. great service. The owner obviously knows haw to please his patrons in every way.  Large portions of fabulous Italian classics. Go.\nYou will be happy!,0
"I walked in and then straight back out.  Also, there was an attack in the parking lot involving a hammer.",0
"Service was just ok, food was good but a little too pricey.  They were really slow to get us food and check.  Would not go back.",0
"The casino, sports book, cinemas and restaurants are above average. The food in the buffet could use a little work, but overall it is decent for a neighborhood casino.",0
"The food was great but the service is some of the worst I've ever experienced. The manager, Samantha, really needs a lesson in customer service. Completely rude!",0
"The BBQ chicken was very tasty. The fries, cole slaw, and roll were not with the calories. Don't forget to bring cash as that is the only currency that is allowed. The service was excellent and very responsive.",0
Environment is quiet crowded and messy. \n\nHad their fried fish thing with some vegetable. Never want to try again,0
Used to be great place. Food is horrible now. Doesn't feel fresh and soup had a smell. Chicken and beef cold inside and all saggy.,0
"Average Mexican food, chips and salsa. Fast on lunch menu service. Chicken Chimichanga was decent, added red sauce.",0
Love this place. The tour keeps me coming back with over a hundred beers to choose from! Food is not the greatest but the atmosphere is worth it.,0
Horribly slow\n\nStaff repeats themselves and is slower than molasses in the winter. \n\nOrder wrong again...\n\nTaco salad bowl was stale not fresh,0
"Really good burgers and the Oak Stout beer is really smooth and tasty. The outdoor seating was nice and the inside was really big, a little loud but a good atmosphere with cute waitresses...",0
"I've been there several times, and I have yet to be disappointed.  Prices are very reasonable, and the food is excellent.  Service is prompt and the banter between the employees is an entertaining bonus.",0
I was extremely disappointed by the rude treatment I received.  I would not recommend this shop to anyone.  As a matter of fact I got a Yelp account for the sole purpose of rating this shop.,0
"I have eaten almost everything on the menu at least twice I think.  Bloody Mary, hurricanes are well done and there is a good beer selection. High quality food in a relaxed setting.",0
Good food and drink. But customer service is awful. Just be be careful who's on staff they might bite. Do not get the Bloody Mary. Buy the garlic fries and the burgers are great.,0
Just stopped in for a drink prior to a ballgame...ritas just lots of sweet and sour mix....bartender very unfriendly to everyone around us.,0
"Poor service, long check-in process and time...total hassle. Will never, ever rent from them again.",0
Amazing 7 course tasting meal but pretty expensive.  $125 fixed price so with 5 was quite pricey.  However food was amazing and staff were top notch!  Will go back!!,0
"The tri tip is only on Tues and Thurs which is my favorite, I love the ribs and rib tips too, along with the best Mac n cheese I've ever had.",0
One of the finest and most caring animal professionals on the planet. Reasonable rates and they listen to your concerns. Dr. Burke should be on your short list of preferred vets.,0
One time I was there it took them about 15 minutes to just get someone to the cash register come on! I eventually just left.,0
Unpretentious Wisconsin-y hangout with good live music.,0
"Great service, great food!  One dish was too spicy. They immediately took it back and fixed it. The Tom Ga Kai was very good. They have this rated with '$$' but the quality exceeded the price!",0
"Not the newest or greatest or cheapest. But if your in the mood for roller skating, it's there.",0
"I love this place.  The food is fresh and high quality.  For as good as the food is, the prices are great!  Highly reccommend if you have never been!",0
Nice selection in bulk. \nFresh fruit and veggies looked better than any grocery store. \nCheap prices and clearance items. \nFriendly staff.\nVery clean store.\nAMAZING lay out.,0
"Although the decor could use some updating, the food and service is good... I was appreciative of their late hours, as I arrived a little late in the evening",0
"We got married April 2014, and our experience was wonderful. Our relatives were amazed at the wonderful Job that was done. Thanks again for making our day so special and memorable!",0
"I anxiously await the pumpkin bars that they make in the fall. They are too good. Also try raspberry and lemon bars. Yum! Good bread, too. Natural ingredients are a huge plus.",0
Great place for dry-cleaning the staff is very friendless and the quality of the work is always good. The prices are great if you live in the neighborhood you get convenience and a price that is better than the competition.,0
"Not a very modern decor - could use an update! The food was good, the portions large and the price was reasonable. I recommend it.",0
"Cheap drinks, great bartenders,friendly people, bands at night. Great neighborhood crowd. Everything u want!!!",0
"Terrible! Wings tasted like they were all made at the beginning of the day, then reheated when sold. Pizza was below average. \n\nWasted $22",0
"Overpriced, very slow service, food was decent.",0
This is one of the cleanest most organized gas stations I have been to in a long time. The cashiers are fast and friendly. They have really good on the go style breakfast sandwiches. Definitely gonna stop there when I can.,0
The food is very tasty. The restaurant is clean. The beer is priced very well and includes local brews.\nThe radio station IS THE BEST!!!!\nIts good for groups in a semi private room with a scary clown ride!,0
"Nice try, but nothing memorable or worth going back for.",0
Foods great..service slow perhaps just a bad day will try again,0
"great coffee, pleasant atmosphere... worth a visit for both locals and tourists...\n\n\nthe coffee was brewed just right... a bastion of happy caffeine.... was traveling and met local friends here for coffee --- was very pleasant...",0
"Business is closed as of the end of November 2011.  The only other ones I know of are the one near Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg and maybe the one that was in Bloomington, Il.",0
"Service wasn't very good, and their (advertised) delivery was not available (because the delivery drivers car broke down). Maybe as a sit in it would be ok but I was not impressed",0
Belch. Not sure how these places have survived. Save yourself some cash and get Frys deli fried chicken.,0
Great asparagus split pea Parmesan soup! Cesar salad had a bit too much dressing. But chicken on it was perfect!,0
Food was great. They've got a great menu to choose from....Also the service was excellent. I've been here many times and it's consistently been a great place to dine.,0
Wonderful neighborhood Italian spot. Waiter was from Milan. Great evening!,0
"I used to love going here, but recently every time i call the phone has been disconnected.",0
First time here. No drive thru. Tayler was very nice and took great care of me.,0
The place was clean and the front desk was friendly. If your hungry tree is a Denny's walking distance from the hotel.,0
"I would give it 5 starts but it can be quite \""Bro'd out\"", for lack of a better term, at times. Good beer and good food though!",0
Great place with a cool college vibe. The rolls are unique to the community and the service is awesome!\n\n$1.50 beers during happy hour!,0
"The food was good, service was good, homemade tea tasted good. Honestly, we had no complaints about this restaurant. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area.",0
There was a 40 minute line for a car... And so many people waiting. I would anywhere rather than wait that long... Not recommended,0
Prices have gone up at way to much for the food and the service is not always good. I had to keep asking for drink refills and chips,0
"This place has a back woods diner kind of feel, It's cute! But the food is nothing special. Muffins we pretty good though...",0
This place is always understaffed.  You can wait in line to check out for 20 min. or more.  Also their check-out process seems less than efficient.,0
WOW!  It was awesome. Peppers suffer with dungeness crab.,0
2 stars only because the service was good.  Food sucked.,0
Pretty good spot for drink specials and to catch the game.. Everybody nice there.. No complaints,0
not happy with this dealership because you cant reach anyone in service and it goes straight to the answering machine and then they never return your calls.,0
1 word fish and chips...ok that's 3 words. The service was awesome and the staff friendly.,0
"This airport, unlike any other, is all about getting zero sleep before you zombie walk in to the place, to your gate, and on to your plane. Being fully rested makes the security buzzer go off and is highly not recommended.",0
Good taco shop with flavorful food; everyone enjoyed their lunch.,0
"Great little spot-took out if town guests here for breakfast and they loved it!  Breakfast menu was big and had plenty to choose from.  Airplanes kept the little ones entertained too,which is always great!",0
"Horrible customer service...had the owner yelling, put his finger in my gf's face. It's too bad he couldn't even look at my plate to see the hair on it. Never... ever go here.",0
"The food is amazing, but you might want to consider carrying a weapon when you come. You might end up getting shanked.",0
They have really tasty wings and i LOVE their pizza! Delivery is always fast and they have coupons regularly in the paper. We really go here for the Hot Wings but they are so addicting and delicious that we can't help it!,0
Always here on Sundays and every time great food and nice to chill while listening to karaoke. Great people.,0
"Great beer, amazing food. Parking is the only drawback. It's like being in a real city.",0
Great food. Restaurant is undergoing renovation - but don't let that stop you from going there.,0
$4 Corona on a Sunday night?  This did not even feel like the same bar as the 8th St location by ASU campus.  Nothing but d-bags and ladies playing dress-up.  One beer and out.,0
Great. The owner just made us dinner. We didn't even look at a menu. No corkage fee on the wine. All good.,0
Food was mediocre and service was abysmal.  I'm shocked this place has a high rating on Yelp.  There are dozens of better Indian options in this area.,0
Great food!!!!! I had a bag egg roll last time but its a hit or miss. But best Chinese food  around this area,0
Not pleased with service. Very poor customer service.,0
It's been over a year since i have been here. Everything was decent the food was fresh. \nThe employees were very friendly and it was kept clean inside. Will most likely be back in soon.,0
"Went here for breakfast with a friend.  The food was decent, and I don't recall feeling like I paid a lot for it (that's a good thing right?).  Just a bit far from campus if you are a student.",0
Hour wait when I had a reservation. Only two salespeople on the morning of a new phone release. Are you kidding me!,0
Kick ass breakfast place.  Friendly efficeint staff serve up tasty fresh food!,0
"Decent place, stopped by for dinner for a friends birthday.  \n\nFood was good, but the real winner here is the service!",0
Fun place to grab a beer and some food with friends. Old school atmosphere but if you want a local joint type place this is definitely the place.,0
"Overpriced, usually burnt, tasteless, if you're spending this much money on these bad burgers you might as well just go to Blue Plate a mile or two down atwood and get something worth your time.",0
"carrie's thinks that old stuff costs more than new stuff, but this is not the case.",0
Great subs and cool atmosphere! I make sure I hit this place every time I am in town. They have expanded since the last time I was in and there are plenty of tables now!,0
Used to be good a few years ago now plan on leaving dirty : (,0
"Very old place and you can't even get a drink at a decent price, we paid $8 a Stella Artois...On Tap! BS! Don't bother going.",0
Have been going there for about 3 years. I usually go there to get some cold beers. I lalways get draft Kirin Ichiban. They offer great variety of foods and desserts. Employees are very attentive and kind.,0
Best wings in the WORLD! Twice baked Cajun wings. Cold beer and friendly people. The Italian food is good also.,0
"Avoid this place!  Rip off, rude, incompetent.  If you do go here, look around at how there's no one else in the shop, and the empty garage.  Turn around and leave before they touch your vehicle.",0
Excellent food. Great prices. The only place on the west coast with properly prepared bagels. Friendly and polite staff.,0
The food is good but you need to demand your bills. breakdown of orders are somewhat vague. We just felt we are somewhat overcharged. I'm so hesitant to visit this restaurant even though it's near us.,0
Me & some friends came here for lunch but an hour pass by & we never received our food... we end up leaving because our lunch time was over... never coming back to this restaurant,0
"Beautiful produce, great selection of herbs. Huge meat and fish market. The place to go for Asian foods, noodles, rice.",0
Went there just to get coffee in the morning and the one thing I need in the morning COFFEE was apparently out of order.,0
Very good food. Very good atmosphere!!! We will definitely come back!!! The tostadas and the fried fish were excellent. The fish was very moisture.,0
Ugh! Walmart. I wish the staff here cared more.,0
"One of my favorite pizza places!! I've only ordered delivery but would dine in if I wasn't so lazy!!! ;) I love the wheat crust option!!! Zucchini sticks are delicious..,and I could go on...!!!!",0
"Love love this place. Sooooo gooooooood!  Recommend highly,",0
"The view is nice, but the food was cold and service was REALLY slow. Better off just getting foods from one of the stands. Was hoping for a fancy ballpark experience this was not it.",0
"Generous, fresh and well balanced donuts!  Love this place.  The creme filled do not have overly sweet creme--delicious.",0
This place is awesome! I am so glad we came here instead. Food was great and service was awesome! Come here if u want some awesome Mexican food!,0
"Drove past for years, ate there first time last week. Delicious. High quality. I'll definitely be back!",0
I went here once to get my pants hemmed and got yelled at for not purchasing proper pants in the first place. I was too startled to respond but have since thought of many  witty replies. Oh well.,0
If you have any respect for your taste buds and stomach...don't just don't even try this place because the grease and soggy ness will knock you over and kill the rest of your mall experience,0
"Food was really good, but the only issue we had was the blue cheese was awful and the employees were talking so load in a foreign language. If you want a GREAT burger go here.",0
Under staffed terrible service. If you want a beer your forget it. The girls who man the counter can't serve. The ones who can are running the main counter cooking pizzas getting balls unstuck what ever.,0
They dont care unless u order some over priced shit. Cheesy place.. waited 45 mins for couple sashimi to start.,0
Awful!! Don't desk staff has no idea what they are doing. They overcharged me and couldn't help me with my insurance. I'm also pretty sure the Dr got my prescription wrong. Terrible experience.,0
"Gross! I ordered a turkey sandwich. Just awful. The bread was falling apart and hard, the meat tasted terrible, like plain ol' lunch meat. Overpriced and definitely not worth it. Don't waste your time or money!",0
"Cute place, very laid back experience, friendly people! Not to mention my girlfriend's hair looks great! :)",0
I went with my family to breakfast at this diner. I ordered a veggie omelette it was very good. Basic diner. Nice atmosphere. Love the fact they had flavored creamer for my coffee. Coffee was so so.,0
I always try and get here at least once when I go to Madison.  The food is always good.  I love the tofu scramble.  A great mix of traditional diner food with some great healthy alts.,0
"Decent food at a great price. Unfortunately, the place is so jam packed it's almost an inconvenience to head back to the buffet lines.",0
"So slow. So, so slow. The set-up is horrible, too. It is always a great reminder that Madison has numerous other local coffe choices.",0
The teriyaki bowl with white meat is good.  It's not knock your socks off but I go there weekly to get my rice bowl fix on.\n\nThe lunch service is pretty fast which is a big plus.,0
Stay away from the sicilian unless your want a pound of bread...,0
worst service EVER. why hasnt this placed closed? why is it still open?? \nnever get my order right worst service,0
Ordered delivery and it got here really fast. Within 15-20 minutes.\n\nGot the pork fried rice and it was pretty good. Generous portions and reasonable prices.,0
"Quick to be seated.  Good service.   Best food that I've had on this trip, but not so amazing that I have to come back.",0
"The doctors spend barely any time with you after making you wait forever then rush you out without hearing you out. The staff is incredibly abrasive, and unhelpful.",0
Flies buzzing around the cooked chicken. Employees were aware of this but did not seem to be very concerned. Go to this location if you are desperate for poorly protected and unsanitary fried chicken.,0
Visiting town w work.\nWanted a good meal.\nFood and atmosphere were excellent.\nI will visit again when back in town,0
Many great revolving beers on tap and a delish black-bean burger. Play pool inside or sit outside -- I love this joint.,0
"Great subs lots of food. Italian stallion was great. Small ma and pa deli, you won't be disappointed.",0
I have always had good food and service here. I have been coming to this Manuel's for as long as I can remember. I love it!,0
"Food was very good.  BBQ pork yummy, good local beers and very good service.  Would come back again.",0
We sat at the bar to watch Kansas beat Ohio and were treated to a royal show by our rockstar bartender Aaron.  The food was so amazing we returned the next day for your last dinner together for our trip to Arizona.,0
Pretty good food at an acceptable price. They seem to have a good beer selection too. The server was very friendly and responsive. Good place.,0
I LOVE Luv-It Custard! Best hole in the wall oce cream ever!,0
"Ran in for a quick lunch, had the cheese burger special.  Good food at a fair price, bartender (Stephanie) is a great gal.  I've always had a good time!",0
"OK, it's an Einstein's - enough said. Great coffee, good bagels, lousy service. You know the drill.",0
Delicious. This place is always clean. My order is usually done correctly.,0
"Service was not good, they forgot about us after our dinner was served. Chips tasted stale.",0
"Average. Not the same as the jerk places in Chicago, but ok I guess. Food was sort of cold and rushed. My partner's pork was shredded and dry. The rice and beans were great.",0
The food here is amazing! Everything is delicious from the soup to the pitas! I would recommend this to anyone! A great change for a great price!,0
Had dinner here last night. It's was ok. Not what I expected. Semi cafeteria type service.,0
Very family-friendly; one area of the restaurant is kid-oriented. Service was fast and friendly and the prices reasonable. Delicious ice cream.,0
"This place is great if you want Asian food that is good and consistent. I always get the szechuan chicken bowl, tom kah soup, and crab rangoon. It's cheap and delicious.",0
Not the greatest but they always have great deals... Hard to resist! Usually a great crowd too!,0
"Very disappointed with amount they assigned to goods was so shocked I literally did not refuse payment but went back to make sure they had given full credit,still don't believe they did check all items. Will never consign there again.",0
Innovative southwestern cooking. Small plates can make a meal. The duck confit relleno is to die for. Truly a first class wine list.,0
Watery coffee. Tea water lukewarm. Food unexceptional. Noisy. Why all the stars again?,0
Great Lunch Specials! Food is always fresh and hot. We go so often they know what we want as soon as we sit down.,0
Me and hubby are enjoying our lunch. Thanks for great service and good food. Terrific value too.,0
It's a chain.\n\nThat is all.,0
Nice course. Definitely over priced. Fairways are wide. Rough is generous. Greens are very challenging but well cared for. Staff is nice too.,0
Overcrowded market. Nothing worth a crap. Overpriced with no real selection. \nDirty as well.,0
"Long unneCessary waits sometimes!\n..... Poor customer service.  Which leads me to believe, unsanitary practices are being performed here possibly. Avoid this place if u want",0
This place has a great vibe and the staff here are super friendly and accommodating. Definitely a great place to hang out and chill with friends.,0
Another superb meal for me and two friends. Same exceptional service. Will be back.,0
This place is always busy but for me it is hit and miss.  Sometimes the food is delishious and sometimes it is rotten.,0
Absolutely the best veterinary clinic that I've ever been to. Dr. Mike is wonderful with ali his patients and he explains everything prior to doing anything any procedure. Aftercare is explained in detail and will definitely be back..,0
"Call ahead. This place is so busy during lunch, you'll never make it during a regular lunch hour if you don't!",0
Can't tell you about the food cause we never got any. After a 35 minute wait we walked out. Check out the other reviews and I concur. Don't hate your self and go somewhere else.,0
"Not a bad place to day drink, but that's about it. I've eaten here a number of times and it has always left something to be desired. Food is very average.",0
"Better than expected. Many salad bar items, excellent corn bread. BF cleared his plate, I did too. Nothing fancy but good food! Staff very attentive.",0
Pizza is average at best. Dough is chewy and sauce tastes from a can. Garlic knots were okay but could be better. I really can't seem to find a good pie in Charlotte.,0
Going in to look for a Starbuck's plastic cups.  Didn't find the one we are looking for...  The staff was not so friendly.,0
"I love this place!  Great fresh tortillas, and fresh pan.  So yummy! The people are always so nice.",0
What a great event.  A great place to look at cars and people.  Try to get into the opening night gala for a real treat.,0
Beautiful and full of beer.  I ordered fried Brussel Sprouts.  People are friendly.  Oh yeah... It's in a church.,0
"filled with flies everywhere, not matter if it is in a nice area, it is still covered with flies.\nIt is zoo bad, it is on your food and walls and everywhere.",0
Don't stay here. You have to carry your own luggage up the stairs. No elevator.  Staff not helpful at all.,0
Wanted to try because of all the great reviews but sadly a little disappointed. Service was really great but unfortunately the food was mediocre.,0
Fun college bar.  This is the place to go see girls dancing on the bar.  Top 40 music.,0
My favorite place for Mexican food. Relaxed by the lake\nI have never been dissatisfied,0
Woefully understaffed.  One bartender and one server for the whole restaurant. \nLeft hungry and thirsty.,0
This place has great pizza but they have no respect for Giants spring training fans. So save your money and go to Oregano's where they are not pretentious.,0
Outstanding Pizza served in a fun atmosphere by a wonderful wait staff!,0
Love this place.  Great food and unique character.  A must if you live in Charlotte.,0
LOVE the pig wings! i could drink the sauce that comes with them!,0
Great place to go. Friday and Saturdays are busy. Good prices for shady side.,0
Met some friends here one night who frequent the place. It's a great dive bar with good food and a great prices. \n\nBreakfast is great and good music.,0
"Lunch time service is virtually non existant, which is quite annoying when u just drove 10 hours, tired, and hungry.  The only reason i didnt give them a 1 star is cuz the food is decent.",0
Met the owner a few times and it was obvious he is enthusiastic about his business. Babes is a nice neighborhood place.,0
Rude staff. Forced to pay them to package a box they shipped me themselves. Greed at its worst. Stay far away from these problem people.,0
"The Indian kid working at the counter asked me if I wanted to get a non-smoking room because the smoking room I reserved \""smelled really bad.\""  Also, some other Indian guy accidentally barged in my room.",0
Service is great. Outside seating in mild weather is awesome. Chicken Mac and Sausage Mac were both great. Veggie pizza was fresh and yummy. Beer sampler was fun to try!,0
"My sister found this beautiful hidden secret in Henderson and I luv them. It's a one stop shop for me, mani-pedi-wax and done. Thank you Mary (=",0
I love this place!  It's a fun place to sit and relax and sip a glass of vino.  Be sure to order the bruschetta...I especially love the figs and prosciutto.,0
Food was ok. Ordered to go. When I got home I saw that the order was wrong and food was missing. I guess you get what you pay for.,0
Not worth $220 but the course is in wonderful shape.  The greens are amazing here.  The ball actually rolls where it should go.  +1 star!,0
Only stayed one day but was great. Lemon water in the lobby a plus in this phx heat.,0
Place just opened for the day and the restrooms by the food court are already disgusting and the housekeepers are just standing in the food court texting and looking stuff up on their phones while talking to each other.,0
"Great, friendly service.\n\nLoved the potato latkes for breakfast.  And the bagel!  Mmmm... I'm a carb girl.",0
"I've been eating here for years, through the second owner. Authentic Mexican food at a very reasonable price.  Would have rated it higher but on my last visit the sanitation grade has dropped to 91.",0
This place was wonderful. $7.99 for lunch. Quick service. Friendly staff. Great food.,0
I'll go straight price is not acceptable vs. the services!,0
Great store (prices and selection)!  Great people!  Geat cause!,0
"This airport is mad easy to get in an out of.  Unless you play slots.  Then you're screwed.   I don't play slots, however, so I moved right along.",0
it's a healthy breakfast all day looking joint.  Remind me of sunrise cafe in Vegas.   very friendly service and prompt.  Definitely a good spot to go.,0
Expect the slowest service you have ever seen.  3 hours for a meal on a Sunday night.,0
Cool place for breakfast.  Breakfast burrito was fantastic.,0
"I come here at least every couple of months because it's close to me and has great subs. It's usually not very busy which is a plus, and my food usually comes out pretty quickly.",0
"Real reggae music, occasional artists performing live, dancing, and inexpensive drinks.  Small club, however gives you a taste of what its really like in a local island bar.",0
Staff are becoming noticeably younger and with that noticeably less helpful. Take the extra five minutes and drive down to the Target on Lake Mead.,0
"Definately not service with a smile. Order is usually wrong, and workers are rude.",0
First time here. Service was horrible. Seemed like no one was happy except the manager. Took forever to get the food. Order was wrong. Would not recommend this place save your money.,0
"I'ts good to see people say good things about this place. I've been a regular for years. Real nice joint, friendly folks, great beer. They'll even give you a drink on your birthday. Slante!",0
Food was good. Nice setting. A bit pricey.,0
"Great park, lots to do for the kids and places to have a party.  They do need to put a sun cover over the swings... they get too hot.",0
"Incompetent!  All four wheels on the drive way, please.  It's not too much to ask!",0
i was qouted a price and after that i paid more...,0
Great food and service. Very happy with my visit.,0
Very friendly staff and my dog looked so cute when they finished! Great prices too. Highly recommend!,0
"I only came in here because Alice Cooper ROCK, however was not at all impressed with the food and service.",0
This place was nasty... I wouldn't eat here ever again... It cost 60$ for 2 people and the food isn't worth 5dollars... I would have rather ate at McDonald's...,0
3 stars. What more am I supposed to say aside from the fact that I love how they have slot machines inside... haha\n\nSin City baby!,0
I have to agree with Ali O. I like Friendly's better...,0
"So, we ordered 6 pizzas tonight for my son's b-day party. They got 2 pizzas wrong. We went back to complain and got attitude from them and no apologies.\nAre we ever going back? Nope.",0
Will buy a grill and some meat and try my own hand before I go back.,0
Great place to watch a game. The food is good and the beer prices make my husband happy. We like to share the two for $20 meal deal!,0
It's good! but.. expensive and they use syrup and or powder for their fruit drinks.\n\nIf a boba place is going to use syrup and or powder I would expect it to be cheaper not expensive.,0
"This place is pretty cool. Great atmosphere and good food. Their service is hit or miss, sometimes it's good other times they kinda forget about you. I go back because I really like their food.",0
"Not as good as Wholeys but awesome patio and the best service. Go here for the atmosphere, the staff is the best.",0
Excellent food served well by a personable wait staff.\nGreat ambiance albeit noisy.\nShrimp Bisque was Outstanding.\nSome marvelous craft beers with too limited a Growler offering.\nWe be back.,0
"Every time I've been in here, the staff acted like they had better things to do than help their customer. They are also grossly overpriced on most things.",0
"Though some what pricey, the food is consistent. Really like their antipasto platter and gnocchi",0
I've been three times and the food has been great.  Seems no one knows how good this place really is.  Great undiscovered Italian food for locals.,0
Go after 7:45 PM on a Friday night. Thats when it calms down. Sorry to say that the next day I got sick. I will not be coming back here.,0
I think this will be my theater of choice.  There was just something cozy about it.  It has the same downfalls of all theaters~ expensive tickets and even more expensive snacks.  But it was clean and comfortable.,0
"excellent views of the mountains, very laid back atmosphere with a very attentive staff, overall a good place to spend a relaxing lunch",0
Not too shabby lunch deals. NOT DOS GRINGOS ANYMORE.  NOW CALLED ROCKY POINT CANTINA. I dug it. $2 coronas and tacos. looks really cool inside.,0
Excellent food at a very reasonable price! Fun atmosphere. Get there early...it fills up fast!,0
Dependable. Ask the friendly servers for recommendations. You could do way worse in Oakland. Try the roasted root salad!,0
Bad customer service. Very rude. \nFood is really bad and oil used for fries hasn't been changed in a long time.,0
"These guys tried to charge me 5 dollars for a battery. On amazon I found the same battery, 10 for $2.50. Don't ever go here. They are a complete rip off and they have no conscience.",0
A lot of dishes are almost flavorless. Like others have mentioned their curries are almost embarrassing.   Large menu so I'd imagine there are some decent dishes but overall pretty blah.  One standout is their soups.,0
Food and service is always an A plus!!!!! We love coming here! Their salsa is bomb and food delicious! You have to try it :-),0
All the people here are super nice. I really enjoy to have meal here. The price is  also really reasonable. Every dollar you spent here worth more then it.\nI would like to go there with my friends next time.,0
"Sitting outside, enjoying the warmth of the sun...the guitar player on the corner down below and great food and beer...I love this place!",0
Went here for the first time and had breakfast. The hashbrowns and pancakes were awesome. Can't wait to go back for lunch sometime.,0
"The food was okay, but with the setting and the hype I'd heard about the place, I expected better. I even had my friends leftovers and his pasta was pretty it was alright, nothing special.",0
"The food at this Sports Grill is good and the portion sizes are very fair.  The service that we experienced from our pleasant young server was not so good.  By that I mean, the service was very very slow.",0
Very nice course. $30 in the summer with some stunning views of the mountains. Very well manicured on most holes and friendly staff. Cart service was great with $2 PBR's and free water refills.,0
"I don't care if it's authentic or not, what's important to me is how good is it.  It is so good I find it hard to eat Chinese food anywhere else.",0
The pizza crust is great and they have a wide selection of pizza. I had the buffalo chicken.  Very good.,0
Nasty just nasty.  I have no idea how people could give this more than 1 star.,0
"Five stars for my fire-roasted veggie tacos.\n\nZero stars for the heat. My god, Arizona is Satan country.",0
"Terrible parking/access due to an un-phased parking upgrade.  Slow to nonexistent parking shuttles.  The absolute worst baggage handling times.  They do a decent job but come on, you can do better.",0
"The pits man. my omelette was so watery and the \""vegetables\"" were sparse and looked like they were canned. Our server lacked knowledge about the menu too. boo",0
"This place is awesome! These guys are friendly and know their stuff. They have a lot of great beers on hand and make great recommendations. Plus, they have a drive-thru and a cat for a mascot! How cool is that?",0
I try to never go to this store.  I can't get past the weird smell and I hate having to go down so many aisles to find the specific item I am looking for.  I hate the way things are organized.,0
"Gaming, Darts pool table, food, and great staff. Its alittle smoky in there but its My pts",0
I just delivered my son at this hospital. The best nursing/doctor staff I've been assisted by ever. They were very kind and patient thru out my 2 week stay :).,0
My first mcdonald when i got to america. The playground smells horrible.,0
Paul came over to inspect for termites. He was on time and friendly. After 10 minutes he said there were no termites and he did not charge me!!! I will be calling him in the future!!!,0
Terrible service. Very rude food server. Embarrassed to have brought my family there. Will never go back.,0
Great food! There are very few places you can get great Mexican food and this is one of few! Great prices for the food and the staff are great people! I always go there after a night out!,0
"take my son to cut his hair not coming back here, they should paid me  by letting them learn how to cut hair, with my son the cut was horrible, I do not recommend this place",0
"Terrible food, terrible prices, terrible service. I'll never eat here again or order room service from the stratosphere hotel since this is the kitchen that supplies it.",0
"I don't know about this place, the place was dead on a Friday night and the sushi was extremely bad.  The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because of the staff.",0
After spending several minutes looking at the menu i was ready to order.  The first five things I pointed too was not available.  BOO.  Food is cheap and portions is decent.  But I won't be back.,0
Plenty of Bull going on behind the scenes at this establishment,0
"Great selection, they have all the good stuff - even all natural brands.  It's difficult to resist the smell walking by.  Sometimes I've gotten free samples of their soap bars tucked inside my shopping bag.",0
"Stayed there once.  It was easily the worst hotel I've ever been in, including that roadside motel in Vermont.\nThe $.99 shrimp cocktail does not make up for a crappy hotel that looks untouched since at least 1960.",0
"I'm from Mississippi and am here working for 2 months....\""love\"" this little restaurant! The waitress hasn't suggested anything that I didn't love! It's great food with even better service!",0
All I can say about Fate is 'yuck' \n\nThat's it.,0
Best food but worst service. This was my 3rd time here and they forget my food twice!! Like I was the first to order. I love the food but the service sucks ass!!!,0
"The love the dim lights, the temp was perfect, the server was prompt, laid back just the way I like it. The portions are huge but they have a new skinnylicious menu that I love.",0
"One word, AMAZING!! Who would've thought vegan donuts would be good..., I mean GREAT!!!",0
"Delicious!! Not a vegetarian, but this place might convince me to switch over. Had a few breakfast options and was blown away by the Greek plate and the QTF. Excellent coffee too.",0
My husband and I love Del Taco. The burritos and grilled chicken tacos are good. The ingredients are fresh (for a fast food spot) and it isn't expensive. Not too mention they're open 24 hours!,0
Excellent spot for breakfast. \n\nFood is fresh and tasty. Service is excellent. Decor is bright and airy. Ideal for a breakfast business meeting or setting a family up for a day out.,0
"Not pricey at all, quality of food is above average while the service seldom sucks! Need more servers and apparently they are sometimes just too busy to take care of everyone.",0
Everything was great.  The Tomato soup was blissful.  Beautiful venue and exception service.  Luv it.,0
Great dive place with an amazing atmosphere..... burger was great..corndog was like the ones i would get at the fair as a kid...,0
"Delicious sandwiches, cute boys, and kool-aid. I likey.",0
"I'll eat here in a pinch. Noting great, nothing too horrible.",0
"Went here after a run in nearby Frick Park, which I felt gave me license to have a (delicious) hot dog washed down with a few great beers. I can't wait to return!",0
Easy airport to negotiate I see they enclosed the smoking areas and have slots in there s no cig smell.,0
"You get what you pay for here.  For $2.50 per garment, you'll get your clothes dry-cleaned, but you could pay more elsewhere for a better pressing with fewer wrinkles.",0
Good food and great prices!\n\n\nThe food was good and it sure hit the spot. The shrimp chow Mein was my favorite,0
Had carne asada plate. It was ok but not the 4-stars I was expecting. Maybe I got the wrong thing (?) The best part was the ginormous and delicious handmade flour tortilla which came with my plate.,0
It's nice to see all the old signs. Learned more than I wanted to know about sign making. The tour guide was very informative.,0
The food here is just good not great.  Pricing is great for the large portions of food.  Overall a good experience.,0
My steak was like rubber. It was full of tough gristle. I will never return.\n\nThe waitress was very friendly and attentive. Unfortunately that does not make for terrible food.,0
This place sucks! Second time they broke my lug nut while changing my tires. Do not go here! \n\nPlus they are rude and don't care!,0
"For a quick bite to eat this is the place, it is inexpensive and filling. The staff is always super nice, and food is always good. Cant go wrong just wish they would open one in Surprise.",0
The view and atmosphere were incredible. Main course was perfect but the predetermined starters were not the best.,0
The food has gone down hill. The pitas are soggy and so are the fries. I really liked this place and am disappointed in the changes.,0
Outstanding donuts.  The regular donuts are much better than Dunkin or Krispy Kreme.  The cake donuts are about the same.  Definitely our new go-to donut place!,0
"The food is pretty good. The atmosphere leaves something to be desired.  \n\nI liked the potatoes quite a bit, and the sausage.\n\nI didn't like the overcrowded nature of the place.",0
High priced and the clock repair person was arrogant and rude. Take your $ elsewhere.,0
Pretty good delivery of traditional fare. Gotta point out the Fish Taco's as exceptional. Rating would be higher but the service is inconsistent.,0
Food was good. Service was TERRIBLE from the hostess to the servers to the manager.....BAD. The Price of the food does not leave room for bad service. Take your money elsewhere!,0
Sweetbreads! Grilled two different ways. Fantastic. I felt like I was back in BA sitting at the port area..\nWell worth the taxi ride.,0
"Sorry, this place doesn't get it. I went two years ago and it was ok but this week it was C- at best. The catfish was greasy and the oysters were soggy. Must have changed hands recently.",0
"I've been to it a few times over the years, and I've never had a major issue with this store. I tried the new Chicken Bacon Wrap and it was tasty. If in the area and hungry, I would return.",0
I walk by this place constantly. It's a diet of the mind not to run in and get an old fashioned each and every time.,0
"Ajo Als on 16th Street es no bueno, my girlfriend and her brother got food poisoning from here yesterday! that's just gross!",0
Enjoyed a fun night with friends. Best fish n chips! We had a party of at least 13 and the waitress was amazing.,0
Probably a great school for the right student/faculty members. It just was not for me.,0
This is terrible.  The food is very bland and service is very slow.  The employees act like they're the only restaurant in town.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one.,0
Had the worst service ever here today. Found hair in the food also. Won't be returning.,0
Overall its a pretty cool place. Cold beer and good wings but the service us hit or miss and some if the bands bring in a rough croud.,0
"I really love the BBQ Ham, and the hot links.  Tasty stuff, no frills, just good food.",0
"This place was cute and clean and had nice personality, but when it came to the food it was very ordinary. These are dishes you can throw together yourself if you wanted. Nothing spectacular at all, I wouldn't come back to this place.",0
"best place in town for pho, the plate 89 beef and salad is really good... I wish the staff can speak English, the place smell is not so good...",0
Just found my new fav Mexican restaurant.  The atmosphere is really great.  The food is amazing.  Chips and salsa are fantabulous.  Drinks are good prices.,0
We went for a business lunch and were not drinking. It's not a great experience when you're not drinking. :-/,0
"Everything is super fresh whenever we go. Easy to fill a plate with healthy, delicious salad, but hard not to overheat! Their chili is also very tasty. We always try to eat there when we are in Phoenix.",0
I was not happy with the service department.  Service writer had a poor attitude towards helping me.  Repair work was done well and on budget but it is sad how a greeter can sour you on the whole place.,0
"Reminds me of a place back in Chicago me and my wife would eat at. Looking forward to the happy hour there, as the deals looked pretty good, and the food was excellent. Really liked it.",0
"Very good place to find your new pets, so many to look at and play with and take them all home, if your looking fur a new pet come. Check out these pants please dogs cats and birds snakes.",0
"Coffee is good, atomshere is nice, can get  a little noisy, the back room is good for small meetings.",0
"There masala dosa was awesome. Curries and naan were above average. Overall the food is good, but staff including owner are very serious and unfriendly. Better to take \""to go\"" food.",0
